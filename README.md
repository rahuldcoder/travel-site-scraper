# travel-site-scraper
program to scrape trip advisor and oyester website

# running the program
python3 main.py


# input

A csv file containing two columns source and target

#output

The files in the output will go into their corresponding folders which are the column names

So like if the csv file is as follows:

Source,Target
https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g1480252-d316623-Reviews-Kuredu_Island_Resort_Spa-Kuredu.html  ,   https://www.oyster.com/maldives/hotels/kuredu-island-resort-and-spa/
https://www.oyster.com/maldives/hotels/kuredu-island-resort-and-spa/  ,   https://www.oyster.com/maldives/hotels/kuredu-island-resort-and-spa/

then there will be folders created for each file and the name of the folder would be starting from 0,1,2 as in the row numbers.


The sample output file is also included in the repo for demo:
