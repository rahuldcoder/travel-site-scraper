We actually live not too far from the city. But this holiday season of Eid, we decided to take advantage of deserted, empty streets of Jakarta and book one night here.The price here at Pullman, is so competitive compared to other Five Star hotels. But the service you get is above and beyond. We received a warm welcome at the reception and were offered a double upgrade! How awesome is that?After a nice afternoon nap, we headed out to the mall next door on foot. No need to beat the traffic, just a shirt walk to enjoy the best of what the city has to offer. We were also able to capture one of the landmarks of Jakarta. Tried using the time-lapse feature. Super fun!In the morning we enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Sana-Sini Restaurant. As reviewed, we really, really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. They offer several types of cuisines, western, Japanese, Indonesian, Chinese, and countless other options including healthy ones as well.I would come back again, just for the buffet. No doubt about it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The 5* hotel category strategic location in Thamrin City, walking distance with major shopping area in Thamrin City . 7-10 minutes walking to Grand Indo Plaza, Sarinah Thamrin Plaza, Thamrin City Plaza and street food hawkers for those who loce to taste food like a local. For Asean tourist Tanah Abang is hood place for shopping but since traffic bad, alternative is Thamrin City similar products even not too many like Tanah Abang but still have varieties with good price to. Actual distance to Soekarno Hatta Airport is actually 30 -35 minutes drive however it will be dragged to 2 hours travelling journey as Traffic condition. Don't be surprised because Jakarta is one on the city in Asia which have a very bad traffic congestion. The traffic is really terrible that is reason suggest to stay hotel closest to the main shopping mall/foods/ entertainment center for those who loves to be entertained. There is train station closed by. The train cost 80 rupiah per pax from Sudirman Station to Bandara( Airport). Is still a best choice though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's got no bells and whistles, but it's a very comfortable stay for business travellers. Choose the wing with suites. It's not significantly more expensive but is a world of difference. The breakfast spread is EPIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to the rest of hotel in Jakarta roundabout . This hotel has the smallest room for standard size . No separate standing shower . So it's a bit tricky . But service wise . It's a top nocth . Breakfast room staffs amazing and the check out procces so smooth
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventough the room is not very spacious compared to other 5 star hotels nearby, they serve a great breakfast. Everytime I stay in the hotel, I always long for the breakfast. The fitness center and pool are quite okay and there is very hot tube inside the locker room. The location is at the heart of Jakarta, and oppposite is the shopping malls.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great Service. We have problem with our bathroom ( bad smell from shower) and they immidiately change our room. beside the smelly bathroom on our first room. everything else is great.I enjoyed swimming and sauna as it is not too crowded when i stay at pullman
-------------------------------------------------------------------

we came to pullman to have a nice family dinner last week. the lobby was so nice and huge and they have various beautiful spot to take a picture on. after that, we are having a nice family dinner in " Sana Sini Restaurant" located on the right side of the lobby. it was a very pleasant experience. the food was great, it has a various type of cuisine. one of the most complete buffet i have ever dine on. the sommelier, mr Rusli was so spot on. He is such a very warm person, and guiding us through all the night. thank you for a very wonderfull experience. will come again, for sure ! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Got this amazing cold drip and hot chocolate as welcome drinks during our one night stay @Pullman. Spacious room and amicable super helpful staff. Breakfast is also stellar and various cuisines are up for grabs. Would definitely recommend staying here :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed for three night, was awesome. Very friendly staff the room was clean. We really had a good time there. Mas Nova was awesome and very helpful. The breakfast was incredible, very large selection and taste was good. Great location! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As loyal guest of Accor hotels , I found Pullman Thamrin as maybe one of the best amongst Pullman worldwide. Room as typical dynamic dinamis size and chic design but what made me really impressed is the people who work here. It's more than smiles, greetings. It's the willingness to assist and every guest personally by the entire team that made this hotel is one of the best .the room is clean and the smell is good upon entering the room. The bathroom amenities is very nice hotels
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for 2 nights on business and found this hotel to be in an excellent location for the price point - it’s jakarta so ideally, you would want a hotel that is linked or located directly to the mall for easy access, since travelling anywhere is a pain with the traffic, and the Pullman Thamin is right across the street from two shopping malls so you can just reach them by walking across the overhead bridge. The hotels across located directly above the malls are all much more expensive (Grand Hyatt, Kempinski and Keraton) so the Pullman is very good value for money. But then again, if you happen to get a room in the old wing like me, the be prep for a small 90’s style squarish room with renovated modern finishes. Its actually very comfortable for business with fast speedy internet access for work, but if you are here on holiday, maybe you want to splurge on the few hotels across. The staff at this property were all very friendly and everyone were extremely courteous and gracious. Throughout the stay, we were greeted with only smiles! There is also a small pool which I didnt use, but it looked ok. The bedding was comfy and firm, pillows were not super soft types that i hate, but the bathroom is a tad too small since it was designed for a small 90’s style bath tub. The blackout curtains were good but a pity do not go all the way to the ceiling so you still get sunlight coming in. For the rooms size, AC is very strong since it is a smaller room to chill...Will be back if rate is much more affordable then the few luxury options across but is price difference is 20-40%, I would stay in the more luxurious options across.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Size of room quite Big and Clean. The Front Desk agent was helpful and friendlyI like the variant of the Food at Sana Sini Restaurant.The Location near Shooping Mall and Main City so it give another plus from me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our stay was fantastic during ramadhan. Special thanks to the barista mr. Danang who made me the greatest coffee! See you soon my friend, so you can make me another cappuccino. Best regards,Mr Khalid Ouaali
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of great restaurant in the town. The selection of menu is amazing, the service is fantastic and the taste of the food is wonderful.I have dinner with some of my friends, everybody is very helpful and friendly. I would like to extend my thanks to our server at the day Ms. Riza. Thank you
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Macaron is a nice small place inside Pullman Hotel to enjoy coffee, tea time or light meal during your busy business days and also price worthy.The server, Windi, has awsome hospitality, she will make customers back again.I also will coming back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On last Saturday i went to Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. On the reception, They greet me so warm and the place so hommy. All the staff was friendly. When i arrived at my room, the room was clean and tidy. The city view very amaze me. In the morning, i went breakfast at sana sini restaurant. They offer so many types of food from Indonesia, Chinese, Japanese, and Western. Special thanks to Chef Ari, she made the perfect egg benedict for my breakfast. It was so good. I also remember the waitter who served us they are Riza and Deli. They are so friendly and gave everythig that i need. Overall it was a pleasant stay for me. The buffet was the best breakfast buffet in town. Again, the receptionist was so friendly and help me to check out. Her smile make me feel welcome. Thank you Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. I hope that i can visit this hotel again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is my favorite hotel in Jakarta. I have stayed here more than once for long business trips, which was well complimented by the hotel management. More like a home it was!!! Well this is all possible because of the support people and personnel at Pullman who are very professional at the same time very friendly.The hotel properties and rooms are well maintained. Rooms are spacious and bathrooms were spotless.It is not only the properties but the hotel staff as well who make the difference for such great experience, hence special thanks to Merry Chandra, the Senior Sales Manager for her efforts in organizing our meetings, and for Mr. Irfan from the Executive lounge.All the housekeeping staff for their behind the scene effort keeping up the room spick and span. Last but not the least, the food at Sana Sini, the very best spread of tasty food you can find either for breakfast or brunches, very well complimented by daily unique regional theme of foods from the various cultures of the world. I would certainly choose to stay here again in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Went there for ramadhan breakfasting. Foods choices are excellent especially pasta section. They made a simple aglio olio pasta turned to masterpiece. Fresh homemade pasta cooked al dente perfecf for me. Totally worth to visit in any occcasion
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my second visit to Pullman in Jakarta based on my first visit. The location is very central, great if you finish work and just want to walk over to the malls to get out a bit. I always booked the Executive Room which is large, great bed, decent bathroom and amenities. I enjoy the lounge access with breakfast as well evening cocktails and food. The hotel has a grand lobby and as usual the staff is friendly. I do enjoy the good size gym as working out on the road is important for me and there is a good size pool deck shall you want to enjoy some sun or Jakarta polluted air.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at this hotel many times. It is very well located in the heart of Jakarta in Thamrin. Big advantage is it is acessable without the worry of the odd/even car plates day regulation.I make good friends in the Exec Lounge as the staff there are friendly and helpful. Congratulations to Sari and Zammie for their promotion. I believe the good work of Tika and Nathan will be recognized by the management soon. My last visit saw Tere, a very hardworking and friendly lady who really service with a big smile that brightens your day.Pak Hari from the café Sana-Sini is definitely a good advertisement for the restaurant with his service.The only thing I feel disappointed is the fast turnover of the lobby welcoming staff. Used to be very familiar with the group under Bunga and none is around anymore. Of course there is a new guy at the door (I think his name is Seito) who volunteered to help me with communication with the taxi drivers who refuse to fetch then the distance is too near.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very warm welcome and attentive staff throughout the stay, a friendly yet professional service in the lounge by Tika, Zemmy and Irfan. The hotel is modern with first class facilities. I definitely recommend Pullman Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent Check in Got upgraded because of my silver TierFree drinks and food at the lounge 6-8pmMr. Natham & Zemmy have provided excellent service & hospitality The room was loaded with some goodies & waterThey have a nice business centre & gym as well
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is the nicest hotel I've ever visited. When I arrived, I was greeted by the staffs warmly. They are so friendly and polite. The receptionist gave me all the informations with details explanation. The room was so clean and fragrant. It was so comfortable. I didn't take the breakfast due to my fasting, so I took the meal for my sahur and it was so delicious. I highly recommended you to visit Pullman Jakarta Indonesia because the service is so great.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there!!, I checked in on 2nd of June and checking out on 9th of June. These seven nights was wonderful staying in Pullman and I came here to do my trainings and it's my business trip the stay was excellent at this hotel. Some of the service which I have taken from these made me ask their names to refer here Irma, Nathan,Zemmy, Vikri,Tika and Sari. All the best all of them will soon again in October.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything was excellent!Checkin and checkout process was very fast.The staff was very active and friendly.The room, their public area, everything was so clean, and perfect.I'm stayed with my friends, the room looks so exclusive.Pullman located in the middle of the Jakarta, it's was so easy for me to reached everywhere I wanted to go.And also they had a lot of facilities which is incredible!For me, it's worth it to spent money for staying in this hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this hotel, I feel that I am at home because of the great services, the great ambience, really friendly staff and helpful as well.As a business man, I really enjoy hiring their business meeting rooms as it is well organized and tailored to our requirements. Furthermore, the price is affordable for a company which is having continuous meetings with it’s partners. I really recommend this hotel. Ali
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A conveniently located hoteld with easy access. From check-in to F& B outlets and amenities, it was 5-star service.Pak Irfan from the Executive Lounge and Pak Daki from the Front Desk were both very helpful.Great job!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

酒店房間整潔，我訂的是standard 的房間，對一個人的住宿來說空間OK，但如果是雙人的話會有一點點不太夠，但可接受。房間內設施齊備，整間酒店的設施也挺充足的，有泳池﹑gym room﹑咖啡廳﹑按摩服務等，員工的服務也非常貼心 (特別鳴謝前台的 Ricky (對不起我忘記是否叫Ricky了，因為是一個月前的事))。酒店過橋的對面就有兩個大型商場，但橋只有樓梯沒有電梯，如果和老人家去旅行這未必是最佳地點。對面的兩個大型商場也不是相連的，要走好一段路才到，五至十分鐘吧，雖然眼看就在前面...人人讚好的早餐方面，雖然種類很多，各國食物都有，味道卻非常非常一般，就連印尼本地的糕點味道也不好，有點不太新鮮似的。反而omelette 和日本食品不錯，其他就免了。另外必須要說的是按摩服務。按摩服務在二樓，收費一點都不便宜，然而這價錢在五星級酒店的話算是相當合理。服務員的手勢也很不錯，當然不能和泰國的比。不過她們也是看你要什麼服務才給予一定質素吧? 例如我只選擇了半小時的腿部按摩，就真的輕輕鬆鬆有點隨意就按好了。但選擇久一點的按摩反而認真點。最最最可怕是，在按摩過程中所用到的那條布 (用來抹客人光脫脫身上的按摩油) 是會重用的!!!!! 這是我光顧了第二天才知道!! 一切在那個房間的所有用品都沒有拿去洗，卻是用了再用，即是說究竟我去按摩的時候那條布究竟在多少個人身上擦過了? 想起都好害怕，希望酒店嚴重認真檢視這個問題!! 實在太不衛生了!!!!All I want to say is, everything is good, except for the breakfast choice was diverse though not tasty, and the most important thing is!!! The hygiene of the massage service was terrible!! They reused the cloth which was used to remove the massage oil from clients!!! They reused it!!! And I just knew it from my second visit!! Please please please improve this, really disgusting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay for 2 night i get upgrade as pullman Vip program it was fantastic experience when check in the welcomer give welcome drink and oshibori the room was nice and clean the food in executive lounge is good and tasty thanks nathan for the excellent service definitely will come back soon
-------------------------------------------------------------------

hotel staff saved me. They found my lost passport at the airport and delivered it to my hotel. They took the action as a matter of course and were very kind. Warm thanks to everyone. Great service. Luxury food!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We arrived in the evening and noticed that we forgot our passport at an airline counter at the international airport. The staff was very engaged in helping us and a couple of hours later our passport was found and delivered to the hotel. The staff was super helpful and put lots of effort in making us enjoy our stay and to solve our passport issue. Dinner and and breakfast buffet is excellent, delicious with a huge variation of different food from all over the world. Wine list is also nice. The massage at the spa was also great. I can only recommend Pullman Jakarta. Additionally the room was modern, fancy, clean and spacious. I will definitely come again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

nice hotel, good location as its near with Plaza Indonesia and other shopping centre, pullman is always have a great croissant taste.... so yummy... but front liner need to give more smile... they have a big restaurant for bfast taste is good

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman at Jalan Thamrin, opposite Plaza Indonesia is Very highly recommended. Good service, Friendly and helpful staff. The room very nice and clean. Food served also delicious . Credit to Zemmy & Tika.Thank you. Hope to stay here again in future
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had chosen Pullman Thamrin for my return stays was because of the easy accessibility location and the friendly yet attentive staffs to make me feels like back home. The room was clean and neat. With well equipped amenities, it is definitely my preferred choice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is our second stay at Pullman Thamrin. Main reason for choosing it was the central location which enabled us to just walk across the elevated walkway into a few malls there such as Grand Indonesia mall, Thamrin City Mall and if your wallet is thick enough, Plaza Indonesia Mall which houses mostly designer shops (ie. LV, Rolex, etc). The other reason for choosing Pullman Thamrin is the massive breakfast spread; you get local cuisine, Japanese, Korean, Western, Vegetarian, and it stretches the whole length of the hotel width!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed again at Pullman Thamrin this week.What a great service this time. The staff improved a lot its friendship and service professionalism.Being offered a special treatment for spending my birthday at Pullman was a good experience.I noted the improvement since 2016 concerning the professionalism of the staff and the new decoration of level 2.All the team at the exclusive lounge is so kind that you will regret leaving it.The room are well designed, clean, well furnished with all you need (except the shoehorn)Once again, a very good stay
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We visited Pullman Thamrin on May 2018. Hotel was well decorated, staff were super friendly and check in process was very quick less than five minutes. You could give your luggages to staff at the hotel lobby before check in counter and they would bring your bags to your room later on, so it was hassel free. The room was decent , compact and suited my needs, i loved that they provided a lot of my favorite tea selection at mini bar. Bathroom was clean but bathtub is a little bit smaller. Breakfast was great and variative. If you had some free time you might want to visit the gym and pool, its free for hotel guest. The pool was decent size, the water was really clean and the atmosphere was really good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Another short trip and I choose Pullman Jakarta Indonesia as the Location very strategic in the hearts of town and easy to go to shopping mall. During this Ramadhan season, thanks to the Hotel that they are served Sahoor for people like me do fasting while they also provide buffet breakfast as usual. As five star Hotel, The hotel does have complete facilities like swimming pool, gym and business centre. All staffs here very friendly and they are always smile and greetings even didn’t want any guest looks confuse around the hotel they immediately will approach you for some help. Thank you Pullman Jakarta Indonesia for the excellent service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great experience! Everything efficient in the short stay... Room modern and stylish. Exec Lounge really cool with very friendly, elegant and stylish people supporting/serving. All you need for a Biz trip...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Had just two night in Jakarta. Hotel is about 30min from the airport. The traffic is light as I checkin hotel very late, almost midnight.2. Hotel is decent in size & full with modern amenities. Well decor & we’ll maintain.3. Had breakfasts at the lounge this morning. Hotel staff are Super, gracious & full with warm smile. Well done everyone.4. Shopping centre just next door.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I visit Jakarta 2-3 times a year on business and typically I stay 4-5 nights at another 5 star hotel. However, I decided I wanted to try another luxury hotel, so my research led me to the Pullman Thamrin because of its convenient location to major shopping malls and easy access. I booked a room with lounge access where I can have breakfast and stop by anytime for a cup of coffee or snacks. The lounge staff was amazingly nice, friendly and supportive of all my needs. Loved the hotel and will be back again soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Came here during break-fasting hours, so crowded. This place is like a maze and kinda confusing at first but l get used to it later. There's Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, Western, and Turkish food. Japanese and Chinese food are great, Indonesian and Western food are standard, Turkish food is unique. I tried Turkish Coffee, it taste more like herbal drink with strong clove flavor. The staffs are very friendly, Mr. Danang helped me and served me Turkish Coffee, Mr. Rusli also greeted me. Much thanks!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I love staying at Pullman Hotel Jakarta. Great service. Quiet, clean room, and hotel personnel was helpfull. I also slept well. Fantastic location with easy access to lots of attractions in Jakarta. Thanks a lot!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel was nice and in a good location. Good size room and bathroom, very clean. Highlight was the service from Noval, the concierge, who's knowledge of the nearby restaurants was fantastic. Only drawback was the construction happening on the street.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent hotel, located at central city. near by the biggest shopping center in jakarta and Bundaran HI of the icon jakarta. Hotel with good facilities, with friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast and taste and hi- tech equipment in fitness center. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was pleasant time and services they gave to us in the lounge. Miss. Tika & Miss. Sary were very friendly and take care of us very well. Just one thing wasn’t so nice when the hotel have some problems with all the tv channels on 22nd of May so we couldn’t watch tv. But overall was great. Thank you very much, will see you again on the next visit.Best Regards BENOIT PLUCHON & FITRI
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic location for business/leisure. Very warm and genuine hospitality team members, especially Executive lounge team (Sari, Tika and Nathan). One of best Accor executive lounges.Great selection of meals for breakfast/buffet lunch/dinner. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in many hotels under Accor group and this hotel is one of the best , centraly located at the heart of Jakarta , very convenient to get the 2 biggest shopping center in town. I was so astonished by the way all staff politely greet me by name , seems like they know exactly how to treat their guest well. the room itself was so nice , I paid extra charge to experince their Deluxe Room with its 30m2 something which very spacious and facing to the beautiful main street of Thamrin Jakarta. Breakfast was superb . would be coming back soon !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have made the Pullman Thamrin my hotel of choice due to several factors: quality of the hotel property, maintenance, location, and fantastic service. All issues, however small, are always handled quickly and efficiently. I would like to specifically point out that Ms. Suchi from Guest Relations is especially helpful, and always goes out of her way to ensure that my stay is perfect! She always has a smile and a good word for the day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent service from the executive lounge team especially Nathan n Tika .. always with a big smile n cheer up your day.Keep up the very good service .I enjoyed staying at the pullman Jakarta because always happy to see their smiling faces .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's my first time here and I ordered the Gado Gado and tea. The Gado Gado was extremely exquisite and filling!!! I am extremely satisfied by the service here and will come here again! However, the food is pricy so I recommend coming here in moderation. It has the atmosphere of a high class society and the cafe Le Chocolat is generally filled with meetings or reunion with friends. So I definitely recommend coming here with a few friends and not yourself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Thamrin, has been my second home in Jakarta since 2015.The service is excellent in all F&B outlets and the room is well appointed and excellent. The Executive lounge at the second floor is top notch with very friendly but highly professional staff. Currently, Nathan, Suci, Irvan and Zemmy are in charge and they are absolutely efficient.From the moment I check in to the moment I leave I feel well taken care of by all the members of the staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I get a change to stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia at 18th May 2018 and I got very excited to feel the experience that Pullman will give to me, and it was right. As soon as me and my wife arrived at 5 PM, we were welcome by one of the staff and I asked for the check in. He escort me to the front desk, and my check in process only takes several minutes without any problem! When I got into my room at 429 I could saw the scenery around Jakarta city from the window and it has very beautiful scene in the night. The room was clean, the A/C has no problem, bed was tidy and the bathroom has no bad smell at all. Will come back if I have an opportunity. Thank you Pullman Jakarta Indonesia Thamrin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I always stayed at Pullman Thamrin every trip to Jakarta despite the property a bit old but staffs are friendly and always feel welcome. Pricing is reasonable given their prime location right down town.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had very friendly staffs who came with happy bday banner and cake to wish my brother birthday. Was amazing! Truly lovely people. We have Ms Devi Soleh to came up and arrange other staffs to come and sing! Thank you!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When i Came to Pullman Jakarta Indonesia for bussines i found google place it,s Le Chocolat.I mate friendly staff like Mr.Akim,Danang and maike as cashier.what a nice friendly staffs.Thanks for everything hope to see you again...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I regularly visit the Makaron Cafe at Pullman Hotel, jalan Thamrin, Jakarta. Doing my computer work or held discussions with my colleagues, I do those all with a cup of coffee and snack.Service is good. Especially Ms. Jahara, she is very good person. Charm and serving guests well. Thanks to Makaron and Ms. Jahara.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 I came back this week to the Pullman and what an experience, totally taken to another level completely, to be honest I was even surprised how a hotel in the same city could really deliver this extra level of service. My check-in was superb, being given birthday wishes by your lovely front desk team, a nice start to the stay, I must admit at this point I was thinking why I had not been back for 2 years, almost kicking myself. Then the experience just got better and better the longer I was here, and the more I met your truly incredible team… The room was out of this world, and has probably spoilt me for the rest of my life on trips, the bar is now so high after 2 nights in this room..  As a platinum member I was given lounge access, and this was my first visit to the lounge at the Pullman, was not sure what to expect, and then I entered this cool lounge with great décor and a perfectly relaxed feel.The team were again the best, making sure all my needs were taken care of, in fact thinking of things I may require before I even thought of them…. The social hour amazing, and the Japanese food in the lounge prepared by Tere excellent, Tere even spent time explaining what was on offer, a very nice lady indeed. The eggs prepared in the morning, the best I have had for as long as I can remember, I real treat, I even made more time for breakfast this morning it was so good yesterday. If I can I would like to add a few of the names I met along the way, all were exceptional and all a credit to the Pullman hotel and also the Accor brand. Rierda from the reception/welcome area, really so nice on my arrival and also helping me take the grab bike during my stay. The team in the lounge, Sari, Nathan, Tika, Irvan, Marina and Zemmy, great people and so warm and friendly… A great experience!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for a week and it couldn't have been better. The free breakfast buffet in the mornings and the service all around were top notch. Most notable was meeting Rudolf who helped me send a package to the United States. He patiently helped me exchange money and walk me to the nearest post office and act as my translator. There is no way I could have sent the package without his help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Delicious! Not too sweet. Perfect for someone who’s looking for a non alcoholic drink to unwind after a hectic day. The rich blend of coffee + palm sugar makes the coffeee smoother. Definitely a must try here!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First stayed in pullman jakarta indonesia was amazing.. When we came to the hotel, the staff was greeted us with warmful smile. He helped us to check in and offered us the welcome drink. His named is Raka. Thank you Mr. Raka for the service and also the restaurant sana sini team. They were friendly as well. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Kopi Bunduran is so good it is a lifestyle. Make sure you ask for Florence as she makes the best coffee I have had in my 27 years of existence. It is the house specialty and one of the best coffees I have tried.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was astonished by the hotel warmest welcome starting from security team, the doorgirl and the bellman even greet me by name, the check in process was smooth and handed me the key directly to me by step out from her counter. To me this is positive hospitality.     
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever I’m in town I always make it a point to stay at the Pullman. The rooms are modern and wel designed, the gym is more than sufficient, the pool is beautful and it’s one of the few hotels that actually keeps their hot tub hot enough to enjoy (with a cold plunge pool to boot!). Additionally, the staff (particularly Zemmy, Irfan, Sari and Tika in the executive lounge) made my most recent stay particularly memorable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin hotel is my second home in heart of Jakarta City. I always spend my good time to stay for business and family time. Its a most comfortable place for my meeting as well. I would like to share some of my experience stay at Pullman Thamrin hotel. Last april i spent my weekend with my wife and relatives. We had a wonderful time to enjoy the hotel facilities and friendliness Pullman hotel’s staff and GM as well. When i checked out from the the hotel. I left my pouch with valuable things inside in the room safety box and i just realized it the next day. I called Pak Teguh as a Pullman hotel manager to help me checked it. he directly took an action with the security. And in few minutes, he got back to me with a good news. He found it, took a picture and keep my pouch safely till i came back to collect it. I was so happy and thankful.No where else to stay in Jakarta City, just Pullman Thamrin Hotel for comfortable, friendly and satisfaction services. Got to try this place, don’t miss it. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Every time I go to Jakarta for my business trips I decide to stay at Pullman and there's a very good reason for that: I always feel special. At all levels of staff you can notice their dedication to the customer and a genuine motivation to make your stay memorable. Whenever I had a special request, need or wish, it was always addressed. For instance, the chef Nathalie always ensures that my vegetarian diet requirements are met in delicious ways, yummy! Or Tika from the executive lounge will certainly welcome you with a sincere smile and a superb service. On my last trip, I needed to get my backpack fixed for next day, and there was the concierge Setio who helped me out with great diligence in a matter of minutes. In a nutshell, if you are looking for an excellent service level, Pullman Thamrin is the place to stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin is located at the very heart of the city. Walking distance to popular shopping area as well as 24 hours food establishments. It was my 3rd time staying in the same hotel and it always has exceeded my expectations. Staff at the breakfast area as well as the bakery is well knowledgeable and friendly. Warmth greeting also welcomes you as soon as you checked in and even till you checked out.Happy to recommend this establishment to people who travel to Jakarta for work and at the same time looking at a relaxing weekend get away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent location in central Jakarta. The staff were super nice whether it was check-in, restaurant or business center (Zemmy and Irfan ). Had a nice, clean, quiet room on the 9th floor. Room not very large but just right. Worth mentioning is the excellent breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel is very safe.. The security will check all entries every time. Room is big, spacious and clean. It centralized and taxi is easy. The Lobby is nice, the staff is very nice, polite and always willing to give directions. Sogo, senen market and pluit is the places that we visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On my special day i wanna say thank for your hospitality Pullman Hotel! how sweet you are guys. funny surprise last night, im so touched may Allah bless you guysWarm regards,Dianita Putri Arr.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room was super clean, size is just perfect! Breakfast is excellent with wide variety from western to Asian. Love the eggs station and the healthy go to juice! The best breakfast in town!The pool also clean with outdoor breeze, just lovely!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is centrally located and very clean. The buffet is the best I have experienced anywhere in the world. The best thing about the Pullman is the people. The service is amazing. Everyone is always smiling and they go out of their way to be helpful. For example:Raka at the front desk: When we asked if he had any spare sticky notes for a workshop we were running he actually searched the shops after he finished his shift at work. Zaldi who works at the pool: Whenever I order food by the pool he always remembers what I like and brings extra snacks We always stay at the Pullman in Jakarta for work and will keep coming back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just went here with guess, good atmosphere and hospitality, we went here just for a coffee time, I like the lounge, the hospitality of their staff, its very good. also the coffee good and will be come again someday

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The crew/staff are great!! The receptionist Michelle is very friendly and proactive. The porter, Ali is very helpful and lastly, the crew at the executive lounge, are most gracious.My stay here at Pullman, Thamrin is 10 days and the management was thoughtful enough to upgrade me to the Grand Deluxe Executive room, the hospitality given to me was at the utmost excellence. They catered to all my needs. Clean and modern look for the interiors.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I just spent two solid weeks at the Pullman Thamrin in Jakarta.This hotel combines many assets: central location and relatively speedy access to all that matters to conduct business in Indonesia, top class hotel infrastructure (ones wonder why this is not a Sofitel), carefully and thoroughly trained staff making guest feel good at all time, flawless operations and overall efficiency wich is rarely reaching such perfection in the long run (two seamless weeks for me!)Furthermore, the executive lounge is a convenient and cosy base to stay, conduct business meetings, work quietly and also relax with good food and attentive service. I warmly recommend the lounge and its attentive staff: Tika and Sari, Zemmy and Irfan, you can count of them at all times.The last but not the least is the leafy district behind the hotel, where one can walk or jog in quiet streets, away from the heavy traffic, under the shade of lush trees. The Pullman Tahmrin is unique in this respect.In short, a haven of comfort deserving better recognition and visibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a pleasant stay at Pullman Hotel (Thamrin). Staffs, namely Ali , Nathan, Zemmy and Tika were very friendly and helpful. The environment, especially at the executive lounge was very comfortable and conducive for work. Thanks for the excellent service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I normally stay in Pullman Thamrin when in Jakarta, for the location, clean rooms and professional staff, but the most recent one was by far the best! First of all, I got a free upgrade, was given complimentary breakfast and the staff at the Executive Lounge (Suci, Irfan, Tika and Zemmy) were excellent! When I was having trouble connecting to the wifi, they attended to me with urgency. They anticipate your needs and wore smiles that just set the positive vibe of the room, and that’s what true customer service is about! I will definitely stay here again When in town!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A Highly Recommend Hotel with Great Amenities and Fantastic and Hospitable Staff Service.The Location is in the Heart of the City Business District, a wonderful choice specially to those having business trips like me. The Ambiance, Pullmann Jakarta has a nice Interior and well structured lobby convenient for us who's going to check-in after the long journey. More Lounges to be accommodate guest while waiting.The Room is properly interior and designed with simplicity and functionality. Rooms are big that can freely move, Bathtub is nice to relax with after the whole day work and leisure. The Amenities, Swimming pool is great! had a wonderful time swimming and taking pictures. Sauna, Steam room and the Hot and Cold Jacuzzi is a great option specially after i took a brief Cardio work out to there state of the art Gym (Gym Equipment)The Food, the food is Highly recommendable, there buffet gives a lot of choices from Native Indonesian delicacies to Japanese and western food. From Appetizer to Dessert, I really enjoyed every single meal.The Service, from the Parking Security Guard, Hotel Guards up to Hotel Lobby Staff to the Receptionist as well as the Restaurant Staff from the Chef to the Managers and Supervisors, they are very welcoming, attentive and caring, showing smiles and appreciation on your morning breakfast routine. The rooms cleaners are well trained and accommodating, they showing that their loved their job no matter how stressing it to them. Also, I really love the Coffee shop / Bake shop "Makaron Deli & Coffee Shop" at the Lobby, i ordered Hot Choco and I really felt the Love of the Service as it has a heart foam design on the cup. The Service go beyond extra mile as the Barista Staff Imam Syah is very accommodating, hospitable and service oriented person. Its my first to Jakarta but he gave suggestions and recommendation on what things to do and place to visit jakarta. My friends thinks that theres nothing to see at Jakarta but with his help, I can say that my Memories in Jakarta, specially Staying at Pullmann Jakartan Thamrin is one of the decision i did that gives me a Wonderful Indonesia Experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A favoured choice for business trips in Jakarta. Convenient location, reasonable price and excellent service. Equipped with most of the facilities and amenities required for business travelers, and enhanced by warm hospitality of the staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a good stay at this hotel. You can tell that they pay a lot of attention to the details. Fantastic staff service and good spread for breakfast. Will definitely come back again! Special thanks to Fred and Phillip!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff in general are extremely good but need to mention of Mr.Ali who is very pleasant has a infectious smile and very positive outlookYou need to have more person like Mr.Ali in your organization to enhance customer service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As the title said, I wasn't treated like a guest. But more like a CELEBRITY...I was just there hoping to treat myself to a nice decent room with a city view. But to my surprise, I was complimentrarily upgraded to the Executive King Room with the city view and the lounge access. Good news right ?Not really. Here comes the bad news. I had to cancel all my prior plans to cafe hop and walk around the city.Once entered the room, with the pleasant aroma of ?lemongrass wafting in the room, and very clean sparkling bathroom and the fabulous bathtub. I knew I was in trouble. I just want to sleep on the soft sheets and comfortable bed and spend as much time in the room as possible. I've been to quite some places around the world but Its THE BEST ROOM I have ever stayed .. ever.The location is just perfect. But probably not for someone who loves shopping in the upscale designer boutiques. Nonetheless, nil complaints about that.The Back Room is perfect for those who just want to chill and have a cigarette or two with drinks in the slightly masculine interior.The pool looks amazing but I didn't had a swim ( as mentioned I just want to spend as much time in the room as possible, and I can just dip in the tub )I didn't booked for breakfast buffet but I had complimentary breakfast in the Lounge Access which I tried the Nasi Uduk . Thank you Mr Jonathan for your kind service and assist me in the swift checking out as well.The only regret I had was not taking more pictures in the art gallery at level 2. It was not accessible when I was about to check out :( Apologies to Mr Harley whom I had ask a favour to help me take pictures, even though it was his break time and he went beyond his service to wait for me and take pictures for me.My big heartfelt thank you very much starts from the very friendly security gentleman and ladies, to the concierge namely Mr Filipus whom I think witness my almost crying face when I entered the room in awe. He gave me a quick tour to my room. Special thank you to beautiful Miss Wulan, which i might want to remind the management to treat her well, before she decides to join Miss Indonesia and becomes famous. Her smile and her kind voice is infectious. Makes you want to smile always.Last but not least, kudos and my heartfelt thank you to the fine gentleman, Mr Harley. He reminds me of myself when I was younger. Slightly shy and hardworking. Whenever I'm back from to the hotel, he would approached me and ask how my day was and how was my stay so far. Mr Harley is a genuine young man whom I can see love to interact to guests and makes them feel welcome. As a frequent solo traveller, our few short conversations makes my stay in Jakarta less lonely. He's someone I was very comfortable talking to as I'm a quite reserved person in nature to the extend that I made my one only friend and brother in Jakarta. Thank You Harley. Keep up the good job and strive for the aspirations you have. You had went extra mile for me with my photo taking around the hotel.Thank you Pullman Thamrin. Please send my regards to ALL your staffs again. You guys made me feel like a family and friend for my more or less 24 hours stay in your fine hotel. Do send me a private email if you would like me to feedback on the minor things you can improve on. Regards Mr Yusoff ( but please call me Sharil )
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is located in heart of Jakarta. Mostly who stay at this hotel are doing business trip from around the world. Even though a lot guess are asia but American also like to stay here due to safety reason since this hotel near the embassy of America and others embassy. They have a lot of meeting room so it is good to do events, meeting panel here. I won’t say it is a bad thing but unfortunately the leading category rooms are too small. If you stay at pullman you can walk to nearby shopping center Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. It is recommended for family, business trip or college trip 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Took a one day trip to Jakarta and having stayed in Pullman Central Park before, decided to try out Pullman Thamrin since it's just for a day and just opposite the hotel is Plaza Indonesia where loads of food and shopping is available. Searched through agoda to get the best value for money hotel and upon checking in, got a surprised upgrade with executive lounge access as well as free breakfast! The staffs (Jonathan, Noval, Tesa) left the best impression smiling and greeting every guest. Highly recommended!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I checked into Pullman Jakarta after moving from another hotel in the city. The reception staff were very kind and friendly and we immediately felt very welcome. The room was very spacious, definitely meeting its value for money. The breakfast spread was delightful and the staff in the Sana Sini Restaurant were so attentive and hospitable - a big contrast to our previous hotel. On the 2nd day, I went to the spa, and opted for the 60 minute relaxing massage. The masseuse, Rini, was very friendly and we had a lovely conversation during the session (something I don’t experience very often during a massage). However, I wasn’t a fan of the chocolate bar, Le Chocolat. Their hot chocolate wasn’t as satisfying as the one made during the breakfast buffet. My family and I happened to be in Jakarta during the Labour Day holidays. Facing the main road, we managed to play spectator (from the safety of our room) to the political protests on May 1st, which happened to be quite the experience! The hotel did have the safety of the guests in mind and closed the gates, preventing any unwanted guests. From the warm greetings that we received after coming back from a long day of shopping, to the delicious hot chocolate at breakfast, Pullman Hotel Jakarta has definitely exceeded any expectations. I would personally like to commend Hary, the concierge who patiently attended to us numerous times with our various requests.My family and I would definitely stay here again, top service!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is located very centrally, tons of malls & sights in walking distance, excellent location! Hotel has a chic & spacious lobby, check-in was nice & quick, had booked a std queen room in advance, we got upgraded to an executive room with lounge access- thanks & appreciated! Room with king bed and bad with shower & tube were excellent, view at sunrise over the city unbeatable. Lounge was nice & neat too. In general all staff was friendly, the woman at the check-in desk, Zemmy who showed us our room and Jonathan from the lounge desk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 2 nights on business. It was excellent from check-in to check-out with nothing too much trouble for the friendly staff especially Tika, Jonathan & Irfan in the club lounge & Elda in the bar
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We visited Jakarta for the purpose of attending a friend’s wedding and he recommended Pullman Jakarta to us. Located in the heart of Jakarta near several huge mega malls, you will never get bored staying here. We were welcomed warmly into Pullman Jakarta with a finely decorated hotel and kind and friendly services from the staff. We especially loved the neat and clean suite in Pullman. The bed paired with super comfortable bedsheet were really difficult to wake up from every morning.The toilet was beautiful and clean to use. Breakfast served was really yummy. Overall, I will definitely recommend anyone to stay in Pullman Jakarta. And I look forward to come back to Pullman if I get the chance to.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location, in center of Jakarta, quick ride to most attractions, short walk to nearby malls, 40 min drive from airport.Hotel lobby, dining area are great - clean and classy. Swimming pool, gym and sauna rooms are of decent size - though the jacuzzi didn’t quite work, and shower in locker room didn’t have hot water. The superior room is quite small (21sq m) for 2 person stay compared to other 5 star hotels such as Mulia and Fairmond (which cost ~50 SGD more though). No much floor space, had to stack up my luggage and bags. Turning around in bathroom is a bit tight too - so often hit my back against either corners or door handle. The service staff is very friendly, always smiling and greeting, ready to help. Overall a very decent hotel for its price and location. Comfortable but not luxury stay. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Thamrin is my favorite hotel in the city where I feel like I’m home,since 2013 and I’m staying in this hotel in every visit to Jakarta.The hotel is in the center of Jakarta where you will get everything around you within few meters.The rooms are so clean and tidy.The staff are friendly with everyone starting from the reception till you leave the hotel.The facilities are fabulous like the spa ,gym and the swimming pool.Thank you guys for your warm hospitality and be sure I will return back to Pullman on next visit to Jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had frequently stayed at Pullman for business purposes since late 2014,15. Have always thought of Pullman Thamrin as one of my favourite hotels, sadly work trips often means I’m away from family and I had always wanted to bring family along. So this trip it’s family first and we chose the one bedroom apartment. Everything was splendidly perfect since arrival, all requests were handled promptly and with grace by the team. We even requested the GR officer for a dinner set up outside of the hotel and it was handled professionally. We had a meeting in the hotel in the evening (business was partly the reason we’re here) and our business partners were very pleased by the hospitality too. Lastly our breakfast was lovely too, the spread was great and we were spoilt for choices. Would love to return here again soon and highly recommended, business trips, family trips, all is a pleasure here at Pullman Thamrin!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Spending business lunch with colleagues at Sana Sini and it all went amazing. The food is amazing, the staff is awesome, all team is very friendly and professional. My guests are beyond happy. Thank you for helping me to arrange. Special Thank you for Pak Harri, Soleh & Dean who is dedicated to serve the best on our tables. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin, Jakarta is is conveniently located and a great place to be in. I visit Jakarta once a month and have always chosen Pullman Thamrin my preferred place to stay in Jakarta. Especially the Executive Lounge is very pleasant place to spend time in the evening. The staff in the Executive Lounge is gracious and very helpful. I would like to name a few great staff members particularly Tika, Sari, Wulan, Jonathan and Irfan. They are indeed very helpful and always bearing simile in their faces. In particular, Zemmy is excellent. He is always looking to help his guests and offering to help. I am much impressed by this friendly demeanor and for his willingness of support and help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband and i went for the dinner. The saffs & atmosphere were great. However in honest review on foods; - Some foods were bit salty for our taste (it is purely personal taste though)- dimsum selections were not recommended but the Chinese chef was very kind- veriety of sambal selections were amazing and definitely want to try again! But there was no ‘nasi goreng’ as such in Indonesian food section but in Chinese (fried rice, which are 2 different type of foods, in my view). However i could ask for fry indonesian rice in Live cooking section where a chef makes fried noodle. - Desert cakes made with sponge cakes were very disappointing. The sponges were very dry. The cakes were not melting but broken in my mouth... The desert cakes look pretty but i think need bit more efforts on making delicious deserts. - Lastly buffet includes coffee, and this coffee is amazing. Must try (Idk where the beans come from)And thanks for all the staffs especially Ms.Devi ;-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel staff is magnificent!! There helpful and accommodating they go out of there way to help you particularly one of there concierge name Nova he was so helpful to me asking me every time he sees me if I need anything. Good job Nova!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I came to Le Chocolat Lounge to meet my friend. Le chocolat Lounge is very comfortable place. Florence greeted me with a smile. And then she recommended "kopi bundaran" to me. And it turns the kopi bundaran is a perfect coffee, it tastes creamy, i really like it. Thank you Florence for recommending kopi bundaran to me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The place to be. Everyone is always so very helpful. Room is clean and comfortable. Get to the Sini Sini restaurant which has an amazing array of foods Andy probably the best hotel breakfast out there.Especially helpful was Fajli who brewed up an amazing ginger tea to help me recover from hours spent in aircon!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am impressed by how the front desk personnel are trained. They are greeting the guest by their names! My last stay is in Jan 2018. It’s great feel when you can be called out.Like home, away from home :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a great location for business and shopping. The all staffs very friendly, and very well informed to me. Thank you for give me free upgrade room and free late check out.There is pool at 2nd floor with olympic-shaped - for adult and kids. The pool very clean, and comfortable. I love Kopi Bundaran so much. You can enjoy the Kopi Bundaran at Le Chocolat with live perform from pianist.The hotel very clean and environmentally oriented hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting loving Indonesia, Staying in Pullman for Four days is one of the best memories. Service is impeccable. Staff is awesome, everyone considering chatting with customers a priority; Mr.Teuku Reza Maulana - Asst. Front Office Manager is very polite , humble and very patient. He has a very good listening skill and he is aware of customer needs. Other name will be Mr Rudolf in Bell counter, very helpful guy. There are few more in Front desk forgotten the names but remember their faces. while going for morning breakfast , the greetings and service render is more than expectation , particularly for all new joiners which is less than year. Variety of food is good and quality wise is not bad but we still can enjoy the ambiances and friendly staff services. Thank for taking a good care.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good service mind, helpful and warm greeting from everyone in this hotel. Room is nice and clean. Variety of choice for breakfast. always provide some tip to customer. very nice and kind. Thank for taking a good care.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying in Pullman for two months is one of the best memories in my life. Starting loving Indonesia, Pullman is part of it. Service is impeccable, from welcomers and restaurants to gym and room; Staff is awesome, everyone considering chatting with customers a priority; Sana Sini Restaurant is super, with top quality and variety of food. I made many friends, Rusli, Sugen, Irma, Mariska, Maika, Mitha, Ika, and Dian to name a few.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I keep coming back to this hotel because I always get very well looked after, the food selection is extensive, the room very clean modern and comfortable, and the staff are well trained and very friendly. Highly recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is a strategically located hotel. First time came his staff was very friendly. The first time I got a room on the smooking floor, room 329, while I bring a one-year-old child, and it becomes an obstacle because my child is allergic to cigarette smoke. Then after I went to the lobby, I met a concierge staff named Willy, I told him and his response was very quick, he helped me to move rooms to non smooking floor, without waiting for a long time I finally moved my room to the seventh floor. The rooms very comfortable and clean. Thank you very soon Willy help the guest problem. Then I headed to the second floor to swim with my family. There is a very clean swimming pool, and also comfortable, but there is no pool attendant standby there, I think the pool attendant is very important for the safety of guests and avoid accident. Then I breakfast at the restaurant sana sini, restaurant sana sini is very elegant and the food is very complete and variety. Staff was very friendly, especially Mrs. Wulan, she was very polite and friendly. Thank you Pullman Jakarta Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sana Sini restaurant at Pullman Hotel Jakarta in Indonesia is one of our favorite restaurants where we always enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and definitely the friendly and sincere services extended by the Staff ( Irma ). We are glad to come back to this resto many many more times to come. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My luggage was lost by the airline, but Jhonatan at Concierge located my luggage the next day and had it ready for me. I was very grateful to Jhonatan.The entire service at the hotel was wonderful! The front desk helped with me with charging my phone and provided me with an additional outlet plug. The communication provided to car drivers was very helpful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Been a long time since the last time I stayed here. All of the employees are very warm, kind, and patient with the guests. The breakfast foods were good and have broad choices, too. Room-wise, I think it was a bit dark and I wasn’t brave enough to stay alone here. I’m not sure what time the housekeeping is ready to clean up, but every time I got back from breakfast to the room, it wasn’t yet cleaned up even though I already put the “Make Up Room” sign upfront. But one of my pet peeves staying here is the parking lot and its access to lobby. I always drive by my own, but the parking lot was provided behind the building with no roof. I have been to the parking lot building, but I couldn’t find the direct access to the hotel. So I always park in this parking lot field (since it was closer to the lobby), walk the way from the lot to the lobby with my luggage along the car drive hoping it’s not gonna rain while I walk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel is an exceptional hotel, that caters to both leisure and business travel. Two highlights of my stay there were the the buffet ( you have the options of adding breaking to your reservation do it!) which I did go to everyday thanks to great food and service from Irma she’s the best, and also the spa which includes an upscale gym that has all what you need. Let’s not forget the jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and infinity pool. Even if you’re just looking to get work done they offer cabanas at no extra charge for your comfort. The WiFi is pretty strong so you can get work done with uninterrupted connection. Before I forget to mention the location is perfect there are two malls literally across the road. If you’re thinking about booking this hotel do it. They do care about there customers and want to make sure your stay is nothing less than exceptional. I’ll be sure to come back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We spend the weekend at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia to celebrate my wife birthday. My wife was thrilled with the Birthday Surprise Cake. The location is very convenient. City center, just walking distance to the biggest malls in town, the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Rooms was spacious and fresh. Staff are genuinely helpful, excellent. The kids love the children activities and specially the rabbits. It has a wide array of breakfast buffets, from continental, western, Japanese, asian and locals, the bread are fresh and yummy!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was our first time visiting your hotel,We spended one night here on our family stay vacation.this is great hotel with faboulus city view,the kids love the pool,the rooms were clean and spacious the bed was comfortable,courteous and helpful staff.Sana-sini is nice and cozy restaurant with good standart of service and f&b product they have the great buffet breakfast with many varieties of food and beverage.We recomanded this restaurant for all of you food lovers
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like this hotel location because it is very near with the shopping mall and next to welcome statue of jakarta. Also, because the hotel price is "okay" with my budget specially when im staying with my fam during my mom's birthday. Spent a day in public facilities such as swimming pool, sauna, jacuzi and gym. The thing is, the breakfast restaurant was very complete and delicious. This is gonna be my fav hotel to stay for weekend escape. Thank you
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff was very welcoming and amazingly service oriented. This is what five star service should be about. We were warmly greeted and welcomed to this hotel and a special thanks to Mitha for making our stay extra special by providing us a room upgrade. Hotel is close to two large malls which was handy.The Executive Lounge was handy for drinks and breakfast with fresh food and drinks. Thank you Pak Irfan and Ibu Mitha for making our guest experience just a bit more special.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Its very nice to stay at pullman jakarta In strategic location in jakarta its made my business trip is run well Even jakarta have a traffic jam but in pullman its doesn’t matter anymore And room from pullman has a elegant decoration Nice view , simple and bery cozy 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Visiting the Le Chocolat Lounge is always a must whenever I stay at Pullman. The Hot Chocolate is Super delicious. The manager Mr Arvi is always very cheerful and would recommend the different types of chocolates available. Nice ambience, quiet and a good place to chat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed at the Pullman Thamrin hotel. The hotel has always provided a high quality experience, including the room, food, gym and other facilities. During my visit I had a problem with the air conditioning in my room, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. After they realized that the problem was going to take a while to fix, they immediately upgraded me to a new and larger room at no additional cost! Thank you Pullman and see you soon!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We only stayed one night at pullmans before leaving for Komodo. A pleasent suprise with great service and clean rooms. My dad forgot his phone in the cab we took from the Airport. One of the emploeeys named Nova got it back for us within 30 minutes after the cab left.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks ago me and my family stayed at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, which is located in Thamrin Central Jakarta. From the beginning of check in we got welcome drink, the Front Desk were friendly and very welcome. A comfortable and spacious room .. went down to the lobby there is Le Chocolat Lounge , the crew is so perfect as much as my coffee , well done pullman jakarta and thank you Budi & wahyu (the name that i can remember so far)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time to hotel after marriage. Great experience at hotel Pullman Jakarta .Breakfast with the wife at Sana Sini Restaurant. The food was tasty and varied. Very nice.. . Im so very happy. Bg
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We have again visited the Pullman Thamrin Jakarta. We have been several times already and always the welcome and ambiance is warm and friendly, the staff are all so helpful. A big call out to Filipio - he gave us an exceptional time in the hotel. We must also mention Zemmy and Heru for their great service. We look forward to next week when we return to the hotel. Jaime and his team are a credit to the group. Thanks Guys - from Mr & Mrs Paul D. .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at the Pullman Hotel Jakarta several times ,I think the service was very good .The people there are quite helpful especially the doorman and the name is Rudolf maybe, extremely helpful and friendly.The Staffs were friendly, pleasant, nice and they very fluent in EnglishI like the and the gym and lobby.Maybe I will come to visit soon and stay again .Overall the staff made the stay much more pleasant and enjoyable Highly recommend for business and leisure travellers
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was our second time visiting your hotel. We spent one night here on our family staycation. This is a great hotel, the kids love the pool. We stayed on weekend, so we can enjoy Jakarta Car Free Day on Sunday morning right in front of the hotel.The rooms were clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable.The executive lounge is amazing, especially the food. We always coming back to their omelet, so delicious. My daughter loves it. Thanks to Mr. Nathan, Mr. Ali and Miss Wulan. They are courteous and helpful staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staffs are well trained to support breastfeeding mother. I am allowed to keep breastmilk in their freezer. The staffs were helpful and kind even i made my request at 12am! Thanks to Mr Wandaka who always remember my request.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Highly recommended - Clean, great location, wide breakfast spread, service oriented culture, great amenities… and to top it all, a set of extremely hospitable staff, willing to go the extra mile to make you feel at home: Zemmy, Mitha, Dzaki (from the reception) Sari, Ifran (from the executive lounge) !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I felt an amazing experience, this hotel was great, the receptionist greeted me with a smile while explaining what kind of room I wanted. The room was so great no smell of cigarette smoke even though I am a room permitting smoking.And when I had breakfast in the restaurant it was amazing, the waiters and waitresses were very friendly, and more amazing was the restaurant was huge and full of food. This is a great experience staying here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Top notch hotel with very attentive staff. Food was excellent. Very clean and environmentally oriented hotel. Health club was spacuous and had all necessary strength and aerobic training options. Doorman PUR was particularly helpful, friendly and courteous.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in Pullman Jakarta for 2 nights - received a very warm welcome from the boys: Hakim, Morwana, Arvi and Danang. The food was so delicious and so is the coffee there. Will definitely recommend this opulent hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to spend the me-time in Le Chocolat, Pullman Jakarta Indonesia.it’s quiet and cozy, the ambiance was adorable and the live pianist was very good.Well, i’ve tried many beverages at Le Chocolat, but these are my fav beverages so far, ‘Lollipop’ and ‘Bundaran Coffee’.The aroma were tantalizing, the taste were great, and so the service. The staff—Yusron, Sandy and Florence, were so kind and friendly.i highly recommended this place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my third stay at the Pullman. It’s a great location for business and for shopping! The staff are friendly and helpful and make my stay so pleasant. A big thank you to Nova at the Concierge who found our luggage, organised my transported and even found string to make a handle on a box!! Nova went beyond expectations to make our trip a smooth one. Farah at Backroom restaurant also provided great service and helped us out when time was short!! The club lounge was also exceptional- they remember my name and what I like to drink and accommodate all of my business needs. Thank you all for another great stay. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located at the city centre, within walking distance to the biggest shopping mall in Jakarta.Breakfast is excellent, wide several choices of healthy juices and nutritious Egg benedict with salmon to start the day. Excellent service given in the buffet restaurant get two thumbs up!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying in Deluxe (located in new renovated tower if I'm not mistaken) so the room is spacious enough and comfortable. I've heard that the lowest room category is cramped and small but Deluxe Room type is actually decent. Location wise, I like it better than Hotel Indonesia Kempinski because less traffic and more places to go rather than GI Mall only. And the food, gosh!! SanaSini always become my favorite All You Can Eat restaurant. All the restaurant section (Japanase, Chinese, Western) are equally good, tasteful and the price is very reasonable. Weekend staycation is recommended if you wish to join the car free day just outside of the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first trip to Jakarta and I have chosen Pullman Jakarta Indonesia to stay in.They have proven that my choice wasn't wrong.Everything was perfect, friendly staff, high quality service, experience employees and perfect location.Definitely it will not be my last visit to Pullman,
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A great experience staying at Pullman jakarta Indonesia. The location is strategic both for holiday and work. Surrounded by few malls which are within walking distance. The room is nice, clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly, professional, helpful, courteous and most of all caring! I'm b'fast at sana sink restaurant. The foods are delicious. I like special juice today, especially "Tummy Comfort". I would definitely come back.  "RECOMMENDABLE" 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Full compliments to the GM and his team. The hotel amenities are great (good gym, swimming pool, excellent breakfast), but what really stood out were the people. Really outstanding staff in the hotel.On late arrival i was flustered and stressed (travelling for business), the check-in lady expertly dealt with the situation.The breakfast and dinner staff in the restaurant with A+. Really first class.Thanks for the stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

was checked in for 1 night at pullman jakarta indonesia, first impression was nice and the lobby was huge and have a great fragrance. I get room at 11th floor which is smoking room, , checkin and checkout by Ricky running fast and smooth. And also Temmy help me to bring my luggage. The view from my room was a great view at afternoon even at night, it was pool view. I can see how beautiful jakarta at night.The cake shop on 1st floor was great and have a delicious taste and so many choices, it called makaron the waiter Iman and waitress Vioren also have a good attitude, and always smile. The cake shop have a nice interior for enjoying delicious cake. Then i go to gym, and sauna, at 2nd floor. The gym and sauna was comfortable enough for enjoying my day. The pool also have a nice view and a large pool for swimming, Also there's a lazy chair for me to laydown on the bed . Overall i enjoy my stay and i have a great and unforgettable experience. Can't wait to stay at Pullman again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family and I had a wonderful stay at the hotel. It is near to the malls (just use the bridge to crossover). The staffs are wonderful human beings, they are friendly and helpful. The buffet food are the best!❤️
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow I say again! This hotel, the incredible service, outstanding buffet... there is not a single negative which I can think of and that is a great compliment to the staff.Make sure you treat yourself with either breakfast/lunch/dinner buffet as it simply is outstanding.Also highly recommended if you have any business in the plaza Indonesia mall, because you can use the pedestrian bridge and saves you the never ending traffic jams of Jakarta.Rated 5/5 and highly recommended
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great location to be in if you're in the city - it's a 5-10 mins walk away from Plaza/ and Grand Indonesia so you don't have to worry about the traffic.The staff here were amazing, their service was exceptional! Was pleasantly surprised when we were chosen to be VIP guest of the day. If you're lucky enough, you'll get to experience a room upgrade with a city view, welcome drink & dessert, and executive lounge access. They served us a complimentary breakfast, snacks throughout the day - best of all were the social hours with free flow drinks & canapes. Good variety of food is served at Sana Sini too.Many thanks to the staff for their amazing hospitality - Filipus, Kevin, Hany (concierge) & Wulan, Irfan, Poani (executive lounge). Special mention to Willy at the concierge who helped to order an unique local snack via go-jek - thanks for going the extra mile.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The most comfortable weekend staycation at Central Jakarta. My friend and I felt rejuvenated experience during staying here due to the staffs were very welcome and professional. It seemed like home and comfortable because the room was good enough. I would like to appreciate Tiana (FDA) who did checking in fast. This hotel offered the guest with modern facilities and we loved the pool on second floor. Fully appreciated to Duty Manager Mr. Erick Pradiana and Mr. Raditya (Reservation) who did my reservation with professional. The location is at golden landmark of Jakarta, close to shopping center and Bundaran HI. This hotel is fully recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A home away from home ! I have stayed at this Pullman several times in the past but this trip I really felt a personal touch that made me feel like I were at home . Staff were so welcoming and friendly at all locations and I enjoyed my stay much more than the past . I understand there is a new GM ! Thank you for making my trip memorable . 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were so indulged with the warmest hospitality by the hotel management... everything is perfect for our stay. Great location, good food and most importantly warmest and friendliest staffs.. it was beyond expectation!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s such a wonderful experience to spend our long weekend together in Pullman Thamrin Jakarta (5 stars). Firstly, the staffs are friendly. Secondly, the location is perfectly in the heart of city and the price is really affordable compared to other neighbor hotels. Thirdly, the honeymoon set up for room is incredibly cute and the food is amazingly tasty. Last but not least, when me and husband arrived at the lobby hotel, the staff says “congratulations, madam. You’re being chosen randomly by us to have this distinctive treatment to upgrade your room type up to two levels above FOR FREE! And you can enjoy the social hours (free dinner and wine) at our Executive Lounge this evening”. Omg I can’t say anything except Thank you Pullman and Accor group! Surely will get back to this place. My husband and I really enjoy our weekend here ♥️
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been in a few Pullman hotels before and I am positively surprised of the good evolution of the brand as a distinctive hotel within the Corporate Hotel chains. The service is immaculate and perfect, very available but not with servitude. Amazing breakfast and restaurant. Nice pool and massage service. Only problem I had is that a overcharge in the massage bill took far too long to resolve
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located in CBD..pullman is arguably the best hotel for business. Ever smiling staff ready to help you with any and everything. Sana Sini has probably the best food in town. As a le club accor member they ensure loyalty is well rewarded.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is the quality you would expect, but what really impressed me is the exceptional service. I stayed 3 days and every single member of staff, from the restaurant to reception and housekeeping was helpful, smiling and professional. I have rarely seen this, including within the Pullman group - congratulations!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very pleasant hotel, close to downtown and shopping center. The rooms are very comfortable. Makes me and my wife feels dont want to leave the bed. All the staff are friendly and always smiling. Especially the restaurant staff is very helpful. I was very suprised by the breakfast, there is so many food and i appreciate with the healty corner which is good for my prego wife. Keep maintaining the service and hotel quality. Thanks Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on reviewer's recommendation, I requested for room at New wing, but was advised by hotel that its different room type (Deluxe@new wing vs Premium@main tower) and rate has to be ~double!Room at Main is no more than 3star, old & lacks decent maintenance esp its bathroom(curtain, drain, filling..). A 5star hotel ought to ongoing upkeep its room facilities to keep the 5star standard, and should not focus just on lobby & rely on complete rennovation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Thamrin is the place i am always staying for business in Jakarta - the location is excellent, the service is exceptional and the price is reasonable - hotels in Jakarta are overpriced. I will definitely recommend the Pullman Thamrin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The people at Pullman Thamrin went out of their way to make our short stay most enjoyable. I always stay at Pullman when visiting Jakarta and every time their service is impeccable. The rooms are great and location right in the heart of Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, the service is excellent, all staffs are friendly.When the first time I came to lobby, the guest relation officer greeted me warmly and led me to reception desk for room registration. The check in process was fast and very appereciated our family. Thanks to the boy reception staff.In the evening, I went to gym and pool. The gym room was so nice equipped with modern machine, helpful and experienced gym instructor.While waiting for the sunset, I went to pool and saw the promoted meals; varied pizza, young coconut and coffee bundaran with very affordable price. the staff was nice, helpful and friendly.I had family dinner at Sana Sini restaurant. It was spacious place with varied and for sure delicious meals, and excellent service.They have created a nice memorable moment and successfully made me want to come again, soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my first time staying in Pullman Jakarta. The moment I stepped in, I was greeted by the infectious smile of Zemmy Haris from Guest Relations. He sorted out my check-in (got a free upgrade woohoo!) and helped me book the restaurant for my dinner meeting. Throughout my stay, he kept a personal eye on me, ensuring everything was ok.When I checked-out, Zemmy and Suci waited with me patiently at the lobby for my Grab driver. Zemmy even called him a couple of times to direct him properly. Now that's service! Well done Pullman! And big shout out to Zemmy and Suci for their warm, personal service! They are the reasons why I’ll be staying in Pullman on my next trip back to Jakarta!Mario SinghCEOFullerton Markets
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Unforgettable stay in Jakarta. The rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated, excellent pillows&great bed - easy to get a proper sleep (even having a jet lag). The gym and pool area very nice. Had a great time with fitness trainer Ati, who was spontaneously doing cross fit and stretching with me - I enjoyed it indeed.The breakfest offers everything what you can even imagine - I liked the green vegetable smoothie very much ;-).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple week ago I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, it was my second time stay here cause the strategic location and definitely cause the restaurant in there that’s very recommended! you can find Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, Western Food and of course the dessert so damn good, beside it the service in restaurant totally perfect, and thank you Mr. Fajli and team and Mr. Kevin from Front Office for serving us with the heart of hospitality. Great Job! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Really nice stay - all the staff are super nice. The building is a bit dated and the rooms are large and comfortable. There are two towers, one old, one new. Service was exceptional and will return again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When i came for a breakfast with my fam, actually I didn’t recognize that they were very very very welcome and warm as well...completely!!!At that time they (Fajli, Lina, Sugeng, Riza...I didn’t remember all of their names) gave us birthday surprise for one of my fam, he was a completely surprised & started to cry caused affected.This is the best Hotel restaurant I ever tried in my life, and the location was in downtown, It’s very closed if you want to go to shopping.I came to this hotel then planned to go to swimmed, somebody (her name is Heni) welcoming us very warmed and kind.The conclusion is this Hotel very recommended for all you guys, i meant it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's very enjoyable visiting Jakarta for work, but it's even nicer to have somewhere peaceful and welcoming to come back to after all the hustle and bustle, and traffic...The room is very comfortable, the gym and pool and are treat, and the restaurants and cafes/bars/communal areas are excellent. Best of all, though, are the welcoming staff. As a solo traveller it's nice to have some interaction with staff, whether helping arrange weekend diversions or presents home, talking wine regions with sommelier Rusli, Suci's warm welcome at breakfast or Ferroz's natural enthusiasm Recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Frequent visitor to the Pullman Thamrin Hotel and this round was provided with the accommodation in the Grand Deluxe room at the new tower...Grand Deluxe rooms are nicely decorated and very spacious. Rooms are very clean as usual. Noticed that these rooms in this newer tower have a "fresher" feeling and very peaceful.The executive lounge is located close to the new tower and they have a daily rotation (Japanese, Indonesian, Western & Chinese) of small plate items that you can be order. Food is very well prepared (delicious !) and the staff at the lounge really knows how to provide you with the VIP service!While hotel breakfast selection at the Sana Sini has reduced since the start of the year, there are still plenty of items to choose from across the various cuisine and quality is still top notch...The best thing about the hotel is always the excellent service provided from everyone (doorman, guest relations, breakfast staff, receptionist) to make you feel welcome & comfortable in the hotel... Special thanks to the longer serving staffs - Zemmy, Vikrim, Suci who have always provided very attentive care making this place feel like a second home :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff is verry nice & beautiful. I'm meeting at Le Chocolat lounge, this place is comfortable. I'm drinking hot chocolate, the chocolate is very good taste. The staff greet me very well and with excellent service. Thank you Florence, who gave me very well service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is one of our company’s corporate hotels in Jakarta. In fact, there are many good biz hotels but Pullman @Thamrin is very well located in central Jakarta, offers a great bfast buffet but also an excellent a la carte service by night. - simply the best with “Sommalier” Pak Rusli always around you ;)) check it out ! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Accor hotel always be my first choice when I do my trip and this time I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia since the location is next to Jakarta's Icon of "Patung Selamat Datang" (Welcome Statue) and its only walking distace to get to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia Mall. As my expectation the hotel's staff were helpful, warm and always smile. My checked in and checked out process was quick,upon checked in Duty Manager helped me when he saw me queuing and another staff came to offer me Welcome Drinks and Cold Face Towel. Clean room, comfort bed, lovely warm water swimming pool, Jacuzzy and Sauna has complete my stay. Ladies changing room always clean, dry and they do provide Lemon/Lime drinks there. At the Gym I was helped and guided by the Instructor. I also love the Aromatherapy at Spa and the staff were always offering an help. You won't feel lonely but you will have your privacy. The most impressed me was their Sana Sini Restaurant which have many selection of food from the local to western food. The breakfast buffet has confused me which one I have to go first:). With the amount I spent for this hotel I am ensuring my own self that I did right choice.Big hug for all the staff for their good job and keep professional. Hope to see you all soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best hotel i've ever stayed. The most shocking experience is the check out process. It takes less than 1 minute! Can you believe that. The staff at the restaurant during breakfast were superb. They explained to me what is the highlight menu of the day and give various menu in the restaurant. The restaurant just too big to explore, lol. I just want to add something that could have been better, to have a lifeguard or staff to standby near the pool. In the weekend, there are lots of kids swimming not in the kids area. Just for safety, it would be better to have a staff to watch over the pool.Overall, will be recommend the hotel to others for sure :) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A 5 day half business (for me) half leisure (for mom) trip. Unfortunately, mom got sick at day 2 and I had business to attend to but the lovely staff of Pullman was kind enough to look after mom with great care while I was away. I am touched by the number of staff who approached me with their well wishes. Everyone was genuinely concerned for mom's wellbeing and made sure that I had my mind at ease while I was away. Never have I ever experience such great hospitality. I don't think any other hotel would have done this with such care. I can't thank them enough.Other than that - Pullman is well located with Plaza Indonesia just across the road and Grand Indonesia just behind Plaza Indonesia. Rooms are clean and has everything you need. Breakfast and dinner buffet are delicious; there is surely a cuisine for everyone - very, very friendly waitstaff. What a great experience I had. Hands down will recommend Pullman to anyone visiting Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay at pullman Jakarta Indonesia for 1 day It was fantastic when I come the staff welcome and give the welcome drink and escort to front desk for check in process After finish I going to room the room Is very nice clean and the bathroom Is nice too the swimming pool and the gym also good in the Morning before check out I'm doing breakfast at sana sini restaurant the Food so good They Have so many varian of Food and selection of buffet that u can choose from western,chinese,indonesian and Japanese Thanks to all staff that Already doing a great job I will definitely Be back again for stay at pullman Jakarta Indonesia 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a beautiful ambienced in room stay i ever had. That was comfortable bedroom and aminities for the business trip like me. I'm very enjoyed to stay here and have a good time. Thankyou very much..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I visited Jakarta several time and stayed always at Pullman. Pullman is in the vicinity of my partner's office, but I've never thought about changing. Starting at the reception, where one will be welcomed from friendly and smiling staff, which is really good after a long flight. Room are perfect and clean. Infrastructure is great, cannot even use all of them because of limited time. Breakfast is like in paradise, there is always much more than something for someone. One of the most visited places in the hotel is "Back Door Bar" A quiet place, althought always busy. The team is very responsive, supportive they serve excellent quality food and drinks. Remarkable is the professionality and friendlyness of Elda Pontoh. She welcomes one at entry in a way that you feel like at home and treats everyone very discretly and professional - exeptional. Same is applicable for the entire team. Would like to recommend this hotel for any visitor to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is located just across Grand Indonesia Mall and is reachable by foot. 3mins walk. The bathroom probably needs a little touch up tho as the shower curtain in the bathroom looks dirty and old.All else is good..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Its a very unforgettable memory living in this hotel. The best ever hospitality I ever had. Some hotel crews visited my room.and gave us a wedding cake. Philipus and his teams are very friendly, swimming pool officers were also very nice. Food were so tasteful my sons love it.Love u all Philipus and team. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I go each year for business to the pullman Jakarta.Rooms & Services are perfect.Spa & Fitness center too.The buffet is excellent and the team is very Professional. I d like to thank the concierge and his team cause they helped me a lot to find my lugages.I d like also to congratulate Elda for the managemnt of the bar with the team.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything are just superbly perfect in a professional hotelier way., gratitude for Accor hotels high standard..had a blasting moment since the fastest checked-in, the one and only Sana-Sini's awesome b'fast, quick room service, great stuffs at the Back Room until the smooth farewell when checked-out..Big Up Pullman Jakarta Indonesia!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff is very helpful and kind. Always willing to go the extra mile to make your stay in the hotel and experience in Jakarta more comfortable.The hotel is nice but the staff is the highlight, very professional.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I Always stay in this hotel when I am in Jakarta.Everything was perfect, food, location, people, everything.Since I am a Platinum member for Accor Group, I have access to the lounge.I would to thank very much Ms. Tika for her professionalism, and all her attention she gave to me and all the customers.She know how to make you feel at home, thank you very much.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good stay in this Pullman. The executive lounge is very good. You can eat in the evening lot of dishes. A special thanks to Wulan and Tika very professional but at the same time allways smiling and transmiting their happiness...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin for a couple of weeks - it is always a pleasure to visit. The staff are very friendly and professional, and the accommodation is of a high standard. The food in the Executive Lounge is very good, and the gym, pool and spa area are clean and well maintained. Overall - an excellent experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has the best coffee in the area! I was waiting for my girlfriend and decided to try the coffee corner in the lobby (lovely service by the way). It was soo good it did not matter my girlfriend was late - I just enjoyed another cup of coffee. Later on I learned it is actually a special brew only for Pullman. Very much appreciated. Thank you!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Me and my parents stay here for short time but this is very extraordinary experiencess, for the service and its facilities. The first time we checked in assisted with Sien and Suci, check in process was very fast and not complicated. All people here was very friendly, we meet with housekeeping staff, they also greeted us very friendly and warm. We try breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant, and WOW! They're really greet us very well, warm and feels like family, we were greeted by Dwi and escote us to a comfortable table, Sugeng who when met us immediately greeted warmly, Suci who helped my mama make avocado juice with much request haha. The food here was very very amazing, complete, varied and tasty. We try Indonesia section and meet bu Wulan, she is very kindhearted person and very very friendly, and also politeeee. She help us recommend a good indonesian food, her famous food is java fried noodle. amazing. Then we go to the chinese section, a lot of dimsum options. at that time the kitchen staff who handled me was Raywin, he offered to deliver the food that I ordered, when its ready, Raywin brings a lot dimsum to eat like crazy, and he is very friendly tho. If we request something, it will will will be made by them. Then i have a look to Makaron bakeshop, Oh my goodness! A lot of cute chocolate for celebrating Easter. Had so much variation of bread, cakes and sandwiches! Siti greeted me kindly. I highly recommend you guys to stay here and you guys must to try the food in Sana Sini Restaurant!Thanks Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. My Mom and Dad was enjoy and very happy!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this hotel for short vacation with Family. All the staff really well trained, friendly, professional and hospitable. Room layout and the beds are simply fantastic. We enjoyed the breakfast at restaurant with so many selection and the taste was so delicious. Amazing service from all the staff start from enterence lobby.

On arrival the staff and the hotel were so welcoming , quick to book in and escort us. the room is clean and very comfortable. Breakfast is very tasty and you have a lot of choice. overall hotel pullman jakarta indonesia is very recomended. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't fault the Pullman, this is such a great hotel. Very centrally located you can pop over to the mall for a 5* movie experience, the hotel itself is easily accessible to the rest of the city. The rooms have a really nice bathroom with tub that has a view of the TV, so you can even drink beer, watch sport and relax all at the same time. Nice big screen and the tv on offer is pretty good. Highly recommended hotel for anyone's stay in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

impressed by service level of staff, in particular Mitha who is at the front lobby.. very friendly and professional.. room is nice, with free wifi, comfortable beds, rain shower etc.. breakfast is fantastic.. too much food to try... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been few times staying in Pullman. But only this times we got upgrade to grand deluxe room. Very happy for this because our little toddler can happily running with bigger space. Their breakfast was amazing, plenty of choises from many cuisines. I had very delicious Mie goreng Jawa made from Chef Wulan. That i dont need travel to Solo for that. Hotel personel was very friendly and nice. Bit minus only the room service, i ordered some food but was came cold.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This time we had an amazing stay. We have a 9 months old babygirl and they’ve provide us with babycot and babychair. The Staffs are very kind and helpfull at any level of hotel, at the lobby as well as at the executive lounge. Our great thanks to Mr. Cameron Gardiner for making our wish possible, for providing our babygirl with delicious babymeal everyday until our last day! Woww! And also thank you to Mr. Irfan at Executive lounge to bring babymeal and note it to other staff. Also many thanks to Ms. Mariska at Lobby (Welcomer) to make sure we have a great stay. Thanks to house keeping for cleaning room and give extra water for our baby. Little improvement would be nice, if Sana Sini restaurant could have a better service-staffs. We wait a bit long infront of front desk to book lunch for 12 persons. There was only one man stand behind the table, telephoning, he didnt give us any sign to wait, or even make a short excuse. So we decided to come again later. At Lunchtime, the staff are not really looking for our needs, we have to wait so long. But the food at Sana Sini Restaurant is really good, we love the buffet. We hope we can comeback again soon. Thank you for this time, we had an amazing stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed one night in room 420 - totally adequate room (non view level). The location was perfect for my short stay in town. The gym and pool are excellent and the breakfast buffet is worth skipping dinner the night before! I arrived at 10am and was checked in my room by 10.20am. The staff were truly fantastic! I would not hesitate to stay there again!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I used to travel Jakarta on business often and always I stayed at Pullman Thamrin without a doubt, all because best in class hospitality and five-star service. What really is special to me about the choice to stay in Pullman is with the experience of the stay and the staff over here. Literally from the front desk, concierge and executive lounge including people who are working from behind scene. The hotel always provides the best possible service I could get with my special requests and other service! The location of the hotel is prime with easy to access to a variety of food and shopping options. If you were staying over weekends, you could join car free Sunday activities too, right in front on the main road! The quality of room service is perfect, food I am getting from executive lounge is absolutely fantastic and very relaxing environment. The service I receive from the staff from executive lounge is really top notch. They really provide the service and care above and beyond my expectations.I would credit to everyone who is working here from lobby staffs, front desk, concierge and executive lounge people. I would specially name some of the staffs here who I become friends with after many visits here: Nathan, Tika, UUlan, Sari, Bani, Irafan, Jonathan, Zemmh and Pur. This is just a few of many people I met here who deserve all those credits. I would definitely recommend to experience with the hotel stay if you ever come to Jakarta for business or vacation. Stay to experience it.

So thought I’d order a quick lunch at the pool deck before heading to airport and home to Sydney. Ordered a burger, was asked, “medium rare or medium”, I chose medium. It arrived, but was asked to sign a disclaimer form absolving Pullman of liability if I fell sick. I said, well, “no”, and actually could they just take it back as it is now cold and I’m concerned that they don’t trust their meat. We agreed to call a manager, but took an aaaage before she arrived... So I snack on the fries - as I’m starving and my taxi is shortly leaving. I explain to the manager, never in my life been asked to sign a disclaimer in case a meal a 5* hotel served made me ill... so just want them to take it back. She explains this required to be signed but eventually agrees, but must pay for the few fries I had. Kind of incredulous. But okay. Although I said again please can we hurry this up (this whole episode has taken an hour so far) as my taxi is here and in a rush for my international flight... there is as no sign of urgency, lots of ambling around... eventually I get a bill for a coke which I did not have. But fine. Then more faffing around to get the $4 paid, super late for taxi now, rushing to airport, it’s gonna be tight!

Stay at this hotel with my family on Saturday to experience Car Free day on Sunday. And my choice was right..WOWW your staff is very friendly especially with their attention to my child. Check in very smoothly by your reception Pilipus. Thank you also for Wakanda who helped bring our luggage to our room and when checked out. Breakfast is very complete and your staff at the restaurant is very friendly. I am very comfortable staying at your hotel and hope to stay again next time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a regular customer, happy to go back every time. Older section needs renovation but good service compensates for this. Location is very good, but every time I stay I'm thinking it probably needs a better bar. Best breakfast in town!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spending weekend with my family on this hotelWhat a beautiful lobby, the lobby is one of the biggest lobby i ve ever seenAll the staff always give a warm welcome, friendly and helpfull all the timeStaying in superior room which is quite small but it still comfy and cozy, the design is minimalis and modern (maybe it will be good for single traveler)I tried the gym and swimming pool and it was amazing, high tech machine for the gym and big swimming pool and also it has sauna room which is make it more perfectBut i think one of the best is the locationReally strategic place, it nearby the mall, nearby the some tourism attraction and nearby with some cullinary destination in JakartaThank you for the memorable weekend experience Pullman Jakarta Indonesia!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great Hotel in the heart of Jakarta.Staff Very professional and helpful!They really makebyou feel comfortable.Good restaurant and very nice Pool.Gym is big and fully equipped.I definitely recommend this hotel 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Went on a trip with my friend and was concern about the security in Jakarta for two ladies like us traveling alone. Staff at Pullman Jakarta in Thamrin gave us the best service and assurance with our stay there. They gave us tips on how to get to the malls just across the road safely. The location was perfect for ladies without having the need to worry about taking long cab rides. When we have finished shopping, we could easily get a GRAB, or hope on the BLUEBIRD which is just less than IDR 50,000 with all your bags of items and yourself all to the front entrance of the hotel. Food was easily accessible with their wonderful in-house dinners. Must try the teppanyaki at 26th Floor! A view and hospitality you will not forget. With lovely musicians singing ballads to end your meal in the sweetest note. Pool and rooms was clean. Only set back was the aged looking shower curtain in the rooms and jaccuzzi which was down during our stay. It will also be great for ladies if they do not need to run across the chilled air-conditioned gym to get to the pool outdoors. Will be great to have an external toilet or changing rooms nearer to the pool.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Special compliment to both Mr. Hari and Mr. Fajli of their excellent service at Sana Sini Restaurant at the hotel. Friendly and attentive towards every guest that steps into the restaurant giving each guest that warm feeling. My stay of 3 days and everyday I will just dine in at this restaurant due to that ambiance and their great service. This gives the hotel a plus point to stay in which is why I am always staying in this same hotel each time I visit Jakarta. Keep it up guys will definitely come back again soon. Thank you very much.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a chance to stay in Pullman while I was on Business trip. It is located in the heart of the city hence easily accessible. Everyday welcome & great send off by the cheerful Welcome team really gives you a great start in the morning. The team was really helpful. To name a few Mariska, Mitha, Zemmy (Only these I remember) were always cheerful & helped with all my queries. You guys are doing great job.I enjoyed the breakfast everyday. Thanks to Fazli (only name I remember) to serving the food of our choice.One suggestion if you can include some Indian dishes in the Breakfast it will be good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at this hotel for 1 night for the first time and it's really a pleasant experience. The staffs greeted me from lobby until i walk to my room, even the cleaning lady happily say good afternoon to me.Check-in process was quick, i was served a welcome drink (more like a shot) and wet towel at the counter and also got a welcome drink voucher. But i think the drink they served at the receptionist counter is an alcoholic drink, so be careful if you don't drink.When i entered my room, the AC was already turned on, they gave me 2 extra drinking water both sparkling and regular water, small snacks, and a personalized welcome note which i think was a really nice gesture from the hotel to make guest feel welcome and expected.The room is spacious enough with complete amenities for my standard. You can choose from a wide variety of their pillow menu also. Bathroom is equipped with both shower and tub but it doesn't feel cramped at all. The pool looked nice with a lot of seating area.Breakfast was good, SanaSini served wide variety of foods from chinese, japanese, western, and indonesia that you can choose from. When i arrived at the restaurant, nobody was at the front desk to assigned my seating, so i just pick my own seat randomly. If you wanna go there, seats at the japanese and chinese sections are the best choices because it's located at the very center of the restaurant so you won't feel tired from all the walking.Overall, great job Pullman, see you again soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Third time in Pullman This time we reserved Deluxe King room, but upon check-in we were told there is something wrong in the room and we were upgraded. So nice surprise for the beginning. First reservation was for two nights, but we enjoyed our stay so much that we booked standard room for one night. When we were at reception checking out, basically changing the room, we met the general manager who offered us the very same room we just spend two nights with the lower price. This was surprise number 2. So thank you Sir for this offer, which made our stay even more pleasant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had one night stay at this hotel and everything was delivered so well. No problem at all during check in/out process, so effortless. Even though the room was a little bit small but always clean, neat and cozy. The quality of F & B was so good too. A very nice hotel for me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman hotel Jakarta,and I thought of giving you the feedback which could be useful for more guests.I had a comfortable stay while in hotel.the room was clean and has a very high level of hygiene along with superbly comfortable beds and providing a good nice sleep with my kids and family,and I meet with Mr Jaime Faus, hotel manager,He was very good at the time. And to the next day met asking about the comfort of the hotel,
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel location is strategic, its 300m to Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia, taxi is available everywhere if you wish to go to other shopping complexes. Friendly & helpful hotel staff. Room service is excellent as well, room cleaning crew is beyond excellent. Varieties of food to choose from its breakfast menu. Hotel is good for families and friends.Overall excellent experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed over the CNY holiday and had a blast of a time! Complimebts to Iman, Florence, and Nova for their excellent service and going the extra mile. We hope the management will send appreciation and recognition to such staff :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family and I stayed over the long weekend and was pleasantly surprised with our stay here. Located at Thamrin area, the hotel is just across the street from Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, making it so convenient to get around. We also loved the service rendered by the hotel staff here. In particular, special mention to the reception, Mariska, who was so helpful and made us feel extremely welcomed and valued as a hotel guest. It was a wonderful stay and I will definitely return in the future. *Oh yes, the hotel breakfast was fantastic too. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First about the service:We have (and we travel a lot for our work) never received such good services.All staff at the Pullman hotel were friendly, recognized you and call you by name.From the security guys, concierge, reception but also the restaurant staff. Everyone is so helpful!On the last day of our stay, it was my birthday, when they sang with 10 staff members and gave me a cake with my name on it. Really super!Secondly about the hotel and the room:The Pullman hotel is a nice, big and clean hotel. You have everything you need.Room clean and tidy.The restaurant: breakfast and evening food is very tasty and you have a lot of choiceMassage: was also super professionalWe advise everyone to stay in this hotel if you are here for business but also for holidays.Thank you Hotel Pullman
-------------------------------------------------------------------

very good rooms. Not big but bug enough for the staying. modern and clean facilities. Fitness very good and several restaurants with good service and food.. there is an excellent japanese restaurant but very expensive. the hotel offers the best breakfast in Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I enjoy the hotel, the food, the strategic position! The restaurant were very good. I like also the atmosphere of the hotel. The worker were very kind. I like the room and The service of the hotel was excellent and I would like to mention Dian. She did an excellent job !!! I 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rooms are good especially in the new wing but the pool and facilities like jacuzzi are in the old wing so abit of a hassle to access. Breakfast is fantastic, the home made bread superb. Quality of staff erratic some good some not 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff of Pullman never fails to impress me with their impeccable service. From the front desk staff, like Zemmy and Sian, to the duty managers like Erick and TJ, they never fail to offer their greetings and warm welcomes. Furthermore, every request / feedback raised were also shiftly attended to and addressed.Compliments aside, I feel that the amenties could be improved. For example, flickering lights, leaking shower head, clogged toilet bowl and bathtub are not uncommon during my stays in Pullman Hotel. Stained pillows and bedsheets are also occassional findings in the rooms. If I were staying in a 3 or 4 star hotel, such occurrences would have been easily forgiven.In short, I am still thankful towards the great service standard demonstrated by the staff of Pullman Hotel (there is actually a long list of great staff, extending beyond just the four names I mentioned above). The great service standard outweighs the shortcomings of the amenities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Coming Home to Jkt always Make Me feel good.. one of my fav place to spend the time is Le Chocolat at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia at Thamrin. They Have the Valentine afternoon tea... oh So Lovely... I Enjoyed my afternoon in A Very calming place while I reminisced some memories.. I had long chat with Iman who served Me pretty well.. Love it.. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife booked this hotel as a surprise for me for the weekend during my business trip. The hotel is very central and next to two mega shopping malls.The welcome at the hotel was fantastic, very friendly and welcome drink and cold towel at reception. The room on the 12th floor was nice and spacious.One thing to improve was the service at breakfast, it was slow and had to ask for our drinks three times, the choice and quality of food however is great.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best night at 9 February 2018Came to this hotel for a short staycation in Jakarta...When the first I come, the staffs were so friendly...The place was so cozy....Staff yang membantu saya check in sangat friendly and helpfull his name is Raka. He gave me a good service.Kamar yang saya dapatkan sangat bersih dan nyaman, yang paling saya suka adalah pengharum ruangan yang dipakai di setiap lorong hotel, mengingatkan saya pada tempat spa dan membuat saya sangat relax...Pagi harinya saya mencoba fasilitas gym dan kolam renang, staff nya sangat friendly. The pool is very clean! I like it so much... After that, saya breakfast di Sana Sini and wow....... theres a lot of food there dan karena kalap, saya pun mencoba hampir semuanya dan rasanya benar2 enak! Terutama favorit saya adalah noodle section, the soup is very tasty!!! I love it so much. Chef Topan, help me to choose the perfect condiment for my noodle and it comes very delicious!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a wonderful stay each and every booking I made with Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. As a Le Club Platinum member, I have been offered a check in at the Executive lounge upon arrival, free room upgrade, free welcome drink voucher, VIP treatment, and late check out option. The room is spacious and bright. Air-conditioning is adjustable with good shower. However, there is a shortfall in the bathroom amnesties kits. The hotel used to provide Co- Bigelow bathroom amnesties kits but now is replaced with a local unbranded amnesties. The guest experience have been reduced.Breakfast is average. The variety have been totally reduced compared to my past stays at the hotel. I hope that SanaSini can revert back to the previous breakfast with variety choices. It seems that the hotel is trying to cut costs and being petty. As always, my favourite staff at SanaSini, Ms. Marlina welcomes me as a VIP at the restaurant for breakfast. Well done Marlina and keep up the excellent work and service.Overall, my stay this time with Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is average. Why did I say average is because the bathroom amnesties kits have changed from Co- Bigelow to no branded amnesties kits and the breakfast at the SanaSini Restaurant can be improved or revert back to it used to and not being seen as cutting cost! The I hope there will be an improvement for my next visit to the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is perfect, it is close to the heart of the city. Rooms were clean and a very warm inviting place to stay, especially for bussiness, great ambiance and cozy, feel to return to offer a hard day's work. The pool very enjoyable and where Fitness uses tools from Technogym.. ExcellentWould recommend and stay again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We checked in at 12:30pm but was informed the room was not available and asked us to wait in the lobby. We wait till 13:00pm, room still not available then we asked can we have some free coffee or tea in the coffee shop whilst waiting, the answer was NO, we have to pay if we like to drink any in hotel. Eventually, we had our room after 14:45pm whist the hotel standard checking time is 14:00pm. This is the first time I have for over 20 years international travelling with 5 stars hotel that we were asked to pay for a coffee or tea when hotel missed to give us our room for that late and sitting in the lobby for over 2 hours. I think this hotel DOES NOT what is service!But I completely changed my mind when we had our dinner in the international buffet restaurant. My wife ordered an avocado milk and she like it very much, a waiter, Wijiang noticed it and agreed to tell his colleague next day morning to offer us the same. Very surprisingly, next day morning when we came over to the same restaurant for breakfast, Wijiang direct greet our name with a big smile from heart and direct prepare the avocado milk. We were very pleased and appreciate his excellent services.What a big difference of service attitude from the front desk to the restaurant in the same hotel!!!, I was about to rate no star as I do not think they know what service means but Wijiang completely changed our decision. This is an employee all 5 stars hotel should have. Truly like to provide excellent services to the customers. It does not cost money but a big small from heart!The rests about this hotel? good location, very close - walking distance to three or four biggest shopping malls in Jakarta, sizable pool and clean room. Not much different from lower range 5 stars hotel and Wijinag make it very different, a truly high quality 5 star service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From all the experience staying in Hotel Accor Group during my trip in Jakarta and Lombok, Pullman Thamrin has win my heart and leave me with good impression of how friendly the staff are, well maintain of Hotel facilities, cleanliness of the room, the fun arise when the staff lining up at the side of transportation i sat in, to say good bye when I about to leave the city to the next one, you guys make me laughing, thank you Ali, Vikri, Hary, Filipus and the Staff who stand between Hary and Filipus, also for the house keeping incharge of the room, Sari and Jonathan at Level 2 executive lounge whose taking care of an issue during my stay, and of course Nova at Back Room for remembering the drink I’ve always had. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Been strolling around for buffet in town but for me Sana Sini is award winning. I love the spreads in four different stations that they have. I love most the Indonesian stations specially the Mie Goreng Jawa by Chef Wulan... The kolak and ketan hitam gelato are so unique and giving me new taste of dessert..... Love it
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying in this hotel in December 2017 with my husband in the Club Floor. The room was spacious, quite modern and with beautiful view. Very luxurious room!The location was just excellent.Great hotel, friendly staffs in the Club Floor. Although it was a short stay, it was one of the best ones. Thank you for the staffs making our stay so memorable!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for 3 nights for business meetings. Central location, just walking distance to mall where you can shop and dine. Room was reasonable size, bed was comfortable although only queen bed, bathroom toiletries provided. Buffet breakfast was very good, lots of choices.Overall very good stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I would have rated Pullman Thamrin Jakarta with 5 Stars if it wasn't for a mishap that happened at their restaurant over dinner. I stayed at Pullman Thamrin Jakarta for 3 nights as this was a last minute change from another Accor Group Hotel (Grand Mercure Kemayoran). I chose Pullman as it is very central and within walking distance to the Grand Indonesia Mall.We got a Grand Deluxe room at Pullman in the new wing. The room was perfect, amenities are complete and housekeeping was great. Hotel breakfast was the best in the region with many different counters which makes it almost impossible for me to try all the different food varieties there is over the 3 days stay. Dinner at the hotel was a different story altogether. I was hesitant to have my friend's birthday dinner at the hotel on one of the evenings. But the manager on duty at the restaurant managed to persuade us to. We were a party of 2, one wanted to have buffet and the other a la carte. The manager on duty insisted on helping us to get our drinks. I told him twice that it's fine, i can think about it first and get it later, but no - the manager insisted that he helps us get the drinks first. We both proceeded to get juices as we saw on the way in that the fresh fruit juices were a steal at IDR60,000 or was it 65,000. After getting my plate of food, my friend decided to change to buffet instead of a la carte (this was merely 4 mins since we entered). We were allowed to change, so both of us were on buffet meals. However, upon asking for another juice from the juice counter, we were told that our juices are not refillable and it is per cup. This is where the mishap happened. Knowing that we are there for the buffet, why was our order for drinks not an unlimited one when it is clearly offered at the counter upon entering at IDR65,000 and the price per glass is IDR50,000. Or why was this not automatically changed from one glass to unlimited? This just doesn't make sense. If the person is having buffet food (unlimited) they should get unlimited refills for drinks as well as there was one made available to the patrons. Does it make sense if i were to order 5 normal glasses of fresh fruit juices and pay IDR50,000 x 5 = IDR250,000 when I could just easily order 10 glasses of fresh fruit juice for IDR65,000 ? Why is a luxury premium hotel such as Pullman trying to trick their guests? I don't see this as being honest to the guests, especially when one is an Accor Club Member. I ended up having an argument with the restaurant manager trying to explain to him the logic of this, he didn't seem to understand. This totally made my evening, my stay and my meal totally bad. Didn't have the appetite to eat any further. I proceeded to inform the Duty Manager of the Hotel that evening. Explained to her the situation, she was understanding - however she didn't get back to me on what preventive measures are taken to ensure this doesn't happen to the next guest. Based on this, I would never recommend Pullman Thamrin Jakarta to any of my business travellers who would go there to partly travel for business / leisure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed for 4 nights in January 2018 for sightseeing, shopping & a “Health & Dental Project” to 400 villagers at Bogor on 28/1.The hotel location is great, within CBD and 5 minutes walk to two large shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia). My double room was clean, neat and large & facing the shopping Malls. Basic amenities were well stocked, very comprehensive breakfast with western, Japanese, Chinese and Indonesian varieties. House cleaning and restaurants staff were very friendly. I got advice from staff to visit a wholesale centre (Tanah Abang), about 15 min by Taxi and you can shop till you drop!I requested for late checkout at 2 pm & glad it was granted, the front door staff also called a Taxi for us to airport (about 45 min for US$15). Hotel price is reasonable and I strongly recommend this to business & couples travelers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Chose this hotel for hens party with my girls this place is amazing. Staff and decoration of the hotel very chic and elegant. The swimming pool size is big enough compare to surrounding hotels. We had a great afternoon by the poolside. We got pass around drinks, stayed at a cabana and it’s very quiet considered most hotels in Jakarta are crowd with kids over the weekend. The walking distance to some great rooftop bars and as well night clubs. Lovely place to spent with your crew!!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is definitely a gem in busy city of jakarta. Its located in a great location that is easy to get around especially from the airport since they have new train station that take us only 45 minutes from the airport on the busy friday evening. We were also very happy with the food overall especially the breakfast. The breakfast buffet spread is extensive and definitely was great value added in our room package. The service was excellent, and they were very accomodating to all our needs. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia dated back to 3 years ago (getting older now that I can't remember the exact date!). Anyway, ACCOR Hotels has been my preferred choice for years now.The hospitality here at Pullman is beyond descriptions! They always go extra miles to ensure my stay here in Jakarta is (always) a memorable one. I choose this hotel (again and again) for one reason - the PEOPLE, the STAFF here at Pullman! The experience starts from the moment I stepped into the hotel. Mariska greeted me with her friendly smile (just like 1 year ago) and Rey was so helpful when I asked for more details about my hotel booking; of course not to mention other staff as well who are humble and friendly!My visit to the Executive Lounge yesterday was such a memorable experience for me. I met Sari, Irfan, Tika and another colleague of theirs, who happened to be duty. They are such a marvellous group of staff as they ensure that I had a good time here in Jakarta. This is what is called INDONESIAN HOSPITALITY – hospitality beyond expectations; ‘Kaya Budi dan Bahasa’! I hope to see all of you again soon, perhaps in 2-3 months’ time. Always remember Pullman Jakarta = Indonesian Hospitality!Terima kasih semua, moga jumpa lagi!Ben ChanMalaysia
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One day one trip I enjoyed stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. This hotel, located right in the heart of city. such a good experience, spending staycation here. The staff at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia "went the extra mile" to make me stay unforgettable.the food at the " Sana sini " restaurant taste was nice and it has a good variety of buffet. Services are great n most importantly the staff proactive serve not just with a smile but also services given with sincerity.An outstanding experience. Definitively to be recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just wondering why this hotel is not offered under the normal search engine.except for the bathtub height is slightly higher than normal...all other ratings are definitely above average...in short, value for money except the heavier traffic one will experience staying in CBD area
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I loved staying here! The staff was terrific, especially my new friend, Rusli, the sommelier in the restaurant. This hotel is a great value, especially for those of us who travel extensively. The combination of service, amenities, and price can't be beat!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location of the hotel is perfect for access to businesses up and down Jakarta's main boulevard, from Thamrin to Sudirman. The location allows easy access to the premier shopping centers. The hotel ambience is very modern, with large lobbies and a three-story open air entrance. Excllent choice of music adds to the ambiance.The hotel staff is exceptional! They are all so friendly, very competent, and eager to help in any way. Sana Sini is the showcase restaurant and it offers cuisine form many cultures - Western, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, with a world class bakery, fruit drinks station, coffee bar, and wine list.The gym, pool and spa offer plenty of opportunity for exercise and relaxation - no excuse for not taking good care of your self.The executive lounge and business center has a well-trained staff who are able to handle every business need. And they put on a very nice social hour party in the evening, too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the center of Jakarta's most busiest and central area. Awesome decoration, wide lobby area connected to the restaurant, lounge and pastry shop. The bedroom is big in terms of size with a very good layout.Breakfast is also great. With lots of choices and the display is separated with its own theme, which I think is good. The staff is also very helpful, and they will always mentioned you by your name.Will definitely come back again when I am in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the first time I stayed at the hotel pullman jakarta indonesia, this was so amazing and fun ... although only one night I was very comfortable and satisfied ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was greeted by Mitha upon my arrival at the hotel and she checked me in. I bought Deluxe but I was upgraded to Grand Deluxe Executive. Obviously the property honour and welcome Platinum member.The property maintain itself very well. Accommodation are modern and in the bathroom it comes with both bathtub and rain shower. Water pressure acceptable and housekeeping does their work very well.The Executive Lounge is on the second floor New Wing. The service from the staffs there are immaculate. Very hospitable and feel at home. Evening canapé has got three type of red wine to choose and the choice of food though not wide spread but of good quality.The amazing part of the hotel is the restaurant on the 1/F that serve buffet breakfast. The spread consist of egg, fresh bakery, fruits and juices, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, Sweet and many others was overwhelmed. The place was like a maze. You may get lost and unable to find your seat. I was very impress with the service from the restaurant and how efficient they are because they are always so busy. I have the choice of doing breakfast in the Executive Lounge or the restaurant but for the three mornings of my stay, I choose the restaurant. Because of the setup of the restaurant and always busy, I wonder how does the staffs know the guest have finished their breakfast? On my last breakfast for this stay, sure enough when I went out to take a bowl of soup noodle, my seat was taken by another guest. My pot and half cup coffee disappear and cutlery changed. At that stage it was really very embarrassing as if I gate crashed. Perhaps if I may suggest the restaurant will to have a card or something for customer to place on the table to indicate to waiter and waitress they have finish their meal so much so that guest wouldn’t be caught like me.By coincident Mitha checked me out and she did her work professionally as I didn’t wait long to get my bill and receipt. I am planing to do my return stay with this property.

Also thanks to Ika the night manager who help us when we checked in.The breakfast buffet very sumptuous and lots of variety.Our 4 nights stay there was very pleasant and relaxing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Teuku Reza, we met in the lobby today, I wanted to express my heartfelt thank you - for this team at Pullman Thamrin - in making my stay special. You guys make a me a Cake on my birthday! What a surprise:-)I really appreciate it. It’s very warmth to walk into my room and see the cake esp when you can’t be with your family and work priority drives your schedule. Again, pls extend my thanks to the team and pls continue to drive the effort to delight the customer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Always happy to stay here because people here are so welcome and they are always dedicated to assist you any question anytime . Strongly recommend to try stay in this property, you should like it as me do :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From the moment me and my husband got to Pullman the service was second to none. The staff took their time out to make sure we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. In particular, Noersafa karim and Molana really went that extra mile to make us feel so welcome which made us feel right at home. We travel a lot but this by far is the best service we have received at any hotel and we hope to be visiting you all again soon. Thank you once again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is the second time that we stay at Pullman Thamrin. The location is great. The staff were knowledgeable and welcoming. The breakfast was exceptional and varied (Indonesian, Chinese, French, western food... ) For sure we will be back...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My stay at Pullman was nothing but excellent service be fitting for a royalty. Morning breakfast was great with many choices to savour your gastronomic appetite. If light & quick breakfast is what you are looking for, do have a taste of their many designer croissant. Sink into the local favourite flavour of Taliwang chicken. I am most thankful to Iman from Le chocolate for his excellent service and quick thinking of retrieving my purse that I had accidentally left behind. He was my life saviour that night. MANY THANKS IMAN!. A good shout out to the others Aulic, Wantaman, Filipus and others who had helped with Check in process, Uber bookings and my luggage. Will definitely be a repeat guest at this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our stay at Pullman Thamrin has always been very pleasant. This time, there was a group of 6 of us, including my wheelchair-bound grandmother who had difficulty going in and out of the taxi. The Pullman staff were so kind and helpful to carry my grandmother in and out of the taxis to the awaiting wheelchair.Thank you for always making Hotel Pullman the only hotel we love coming back to whenever we are in Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a wonderfull experience when i stay at Pullman. Which is very strategic location, be in the heart of Jakarta.During my stay all staff very kind and help full, fitness centre and swimming pool was great.i would definitely coming back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Restaurant was memorable, executive club well worth being part of. Staff were professional, friendly and efficient. Suites left no detail out. Location was central, security thorough. Very impressed, thank you for a great stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had the most wonderful stay at this hotel and only wished I could stay longer. Located in the heart of Jakarta makes it easy to go everywhere. The staff were very welcoming and informative when I asked about the best street foods nearby the hotel. The gym and spa were the facilities I enjoyed the most. The breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant was a highlight during my stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. All of the food in every section was just outstanding. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting and look forward to coming back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After almost three years I did not come here. and now I decided to stay for celebrate our wedding anniversary here. all still look very good. as the room was very comfortable for me and my husband. And when I came to breakfast in Sana Sini, I was happy because there were some staff who still remembered me. and helped me to explain some of the food they had.and the important thing is that all staff are very friendly and helpful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for Cyntia for helping check in process, fast and details, also Mega upon check out, Bellteam and concierge did well assistance recomendation interesting places on weekend, Great size room for family,clean and nice view, nice swimming pool for my kids, ibu iis at wellness,very recomended hotel for family on weekend, and bussines hotel in central of city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in December I stayed at the Pullman and I must say the service was top quality all round. They even knew it was my birthday and had a delightful birthday cake waiting for me in my room. The room had all the right amenities with everything in the right place. Ms Dian did an excellent job servicing my room with prompt courteous attention and a friendly smile. Dian was very diligent and efficient.The hotel is conveniently located in the city to meet my requirements for business travel. I look forward to visiting again soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time staying at the Pullman at Thamrin CBD, Jakarta. I have heard good reviews and i totally agree. Room was well equiped, comfortable bed and pillow. Wifi was quick. Breakfast was also one of the best that I've seen. Wide variety of spread and high quality. Staff was also courteous at the front desk as well as the F&B outlets. Location of hotel was also near most offices at central area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a Jakarta resident I did - of course - not stay in the hotel. But I have sampled the food on several occasions, the Sana-Sini restaurant several times. It's just outstanding! Well prepared and tasty food in a good presentation. The choices are many: European, Sushi, Chinese, Jakarta/Indonesian and change often. For example seven different kinds of sambal on the Indonesian counter. Excellent bread (really!) and a nice cheese table. - Five points, no question.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many pros and cons to this hotel. The bottom line is that we nearly rated the hotel with a single star. However, the F&B team was this hotel’s saving grace.One-Star Element. The biggest turn off experienced was the haggling upon checking into the hotel. We have never experienced this and found the conduct offensive. On top of booking a package and paying for an upgrade to include breakfast, the young man at reception felt it was his duty to extract time and money from us and our schedule. We were checking in 10 minutes prior to the permitted check-in time and the young gent’s vacillation between “oh we don’t have a room for you yet” and “but if you pay for an upgrade in the new tower then we have a room available for you” was cause for concern. “How much is the upgrade? We inquired.” “Additional IDR 800,000 but if you book now I will give to you for only IDR 500,000.” We decided to stick to our original booking since we had already upgraded. Within several seconds, and after a second round of trying to get us to pay for a premium room, no exaggeration here, a room was suddenly available for us. Like magic. Probably the worst room in the hotel. Most likely the most dated and seriously in horrendous condition for such a quaint and historic hotel. Probably a room that was available when the National Monument was erected. Think black mold in the crevices and other sorts of unpleasantries. Absolute filth under the rim of the toilet bowl. In addition to the datedness and lack of cleanliness, the room also wreaked of cigarette smoke, though we requested a non-smoking room. The smoke was masked heavily by a suffocating air-freshener, as though a bucket of air-freshener had been spilled into the carpet, linens, etc. There was no way that we would have stayed in that room! Thankfully, the husband worked with a different member of the check-in staff to secure a decent room for us, still in the old tower but not nearly as uninhabitable as the first room.Five-Star Element. We booked this hotel due to the exceptional restaurant reviews. The Sana Sini lived up to its reputation and our expectations. The restaurant truly is exceptional on all fronts. The restaurant boasts of its four regional cuisines-Indonesian, Japanese, Western, and Chinese. Additionally, the fresh juice bar is available, along with coffee, tea, and more desserts than one could count. Can’t find something in the buffet? Order something a la carte in addition to the buffet. There is no better deal in the world. Breakfast was extensive but dinner took our breath away and had us as stuffed as the Thanksgiving turkeys available at the different regional stations. Truly the most extensive food selection we have experienced in all our travels, beating out Hong Kong, Japan, Europe, the US, anywhere! If you like food, you will want for not. Special shout out to Deni and Hari of the F&B team who saved this hotel from receiving a one-star review. Deni and Hari went above and beyond to ensure that we were always perfectly content while in their care. By the way, Thanksgiving dinner is offered. This was a very pleasant surprise. Western turkey and Indonesian turkey. Plus a bazillion other options. Two thumbs up!Location. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was about 1.5 hours and nearly 2 hours in reverse, from the hotel to the airport, first going south then east, then having to u-turn to head west. Be mindful of car-free Sundays. Great concept but it means that traffic can be disastrous when traveling on that day. This also increases the cost of the trip back to the airport. The location of the hotel itself is a dream. Across the way is the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Up the street is the National Monument. Much further up the street is Old Jakarta/Old Batavia. The street behind the hotel has two well-rated Indonesian restaurants (we dined at the Seribu Rada Menteng and the whole experience was absolutely delicious). The Hyatt has at least four different restaurants that cater to those with any of many dietary restrictions. The Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia both have enough shops to occupy a whole weekend and fill it with exploration. Additionally, the Food Hall/Grocery shops in the basement levels offer great quality food and products at not-too-touristy prices. We were able to pick up fresh mangosteens and other treats in these grocery shops. Don’t forget the coffee beans and chocolates on your way out of the country. To the south are the Senayan City (mall) and Plaza Senayan.Another important note is to make sure nothing is forgotten or left behind at the hotel. The Pullman will charge an arm and a leg, practically the whole body, just to return it. Postage is ludicrous. Think $90 US dollars for a tablet charger.All in all, for the location and the food, we cannot recommend this hotel more highly. However, the haggling and the old tower versus the new is a bit much really. The photos online are most likely of the new tower because the old tower is simply put, a super dated shoebox.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I could spend excellent time in Deluxe Room. Hotel people are totally friendly and give me nice smile and kind services. Food(Breakfast) was also excellent, due to variation of cuisine and foods. When I visit Jakarta again, I will not have any other choice than this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 the view and ambience of the building is comforting. The food was excellent, the friendly staff we encountered during our stay!I want you to better understand Indonesian culture, because the upperoom jakarta (building behind the hotel pullman) is often used for custom wedding party examples in Javanese tradition. so guests after the attend the wedding party who will stay will bring keris ( javanese ceremonial knife ) so keris is not a weapon but is a cultural heritage which must be preserved .like what I experienced, my keris is made of gold and diamond but still forbidden to be brought to the room. i already explain to your security but still prohibited.whereas eating knives (not worth) can be brought into the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am very happy to stay in hotel pullman jakarta indonesia..with family memorable good service from me come till i chek out.coffee sana sini food good and service good.swimming pool which is not complete for children.good room five hotel star standard.supplies complete..tanks hotell pullman jakarta indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was the first time that I stayed in this hotel and I enjoyed delicious. Everything was good about this hotel. The customer service, the service to the guests, the restaurant was very good quality, the breakfast was very spacious and something for everyone, they have a good and clean pool with fitness and bath facilities (free), the room was very clean and very well maintained and cleaned neatly every day. I will definitely come back to this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been stayed at Pullman Jakarta for 3nights.Pros: location, breakfast food variation, Friendly staff(house keeping staff left nice note everyday)Cons: Outdated room, Room noise is unbearable!, $200 worth? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice and well maintained hotel, attentive staff, delicious breakfast. Superior Room is small room, but if you just need to stay for sleep only for business trip to jakarta i think more than enough. The room is clean. Definitely my first choice to stay in jakarta. Keep up the great job guys don't let us down :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The larger apartment rooms are well maintained and spacious. The food and service in the Executive Lounge is the best I have experienced. Pool and facilities are good. Location and access to Grand Indonesia is convenient. I would definitely stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We booked a clubroom and received an early check in and late check out. So we could relax at the pool, sauna and gym. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Good breakfast and cocktail at the club. Very nice room. Letter from the manager and fruit and chocolate in the room. All was perfect!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed from 26th-28th December, and i had an amazing stayed. The staffs are friendly from concierge, front desk, and even the chef didn't have a doubt to smile. The room was cleaned, and nice. And i loved my upgraded size room and welcome amenities as a gold member club. The breakfast and dinner were fantastic. I am touched with how friendly the chefs in the buffet dinner. However, i found i am not sure if he is the manager or assistant manager in the au chocolate lounge was quite rude answering my questions when i asked about club member point. But his staff was really nice, he even can remember my name. Overall, i am pretty happy staying here. I would definitely come back here again, and i would highly recommend this hotel to stay!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Service extended to me during my stay was very good. Friendly and helpful staff. Take times toi explain in details. Attended to my request promptly. Room was clean. Many choices for brekfast, western, Japanese, Chinese, India & local.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is in convenient location at city centre, close to business district and few shopping malls. Small room but clean. Nice breakfast with variety of foods. Nice gym, spa with small pool. Friendly staff
-------------------------------------------------------------------

clean room with a good size tub, a great variety of breakfast menu, superb service by the friendly staff. the receptionist and waiter of the sana sini rest was so helpful and kind-hearted. definitely a will-sleep-again hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We enjoyed our two nights at the Pullman at the start of our Indonesia trip. The service and staff were professional and attentive. The hotel is located opposite the Mall making it easy to pop out for shopping and dinner. The pool is a reasonably size. The gym is poorly equipped. Would definitely recommend.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great hotel in terms of customer service, room quality, location as well as food. The breakfast at this hotel is superlative and words can't describe the extensive range and quality. Easily this was the best breakfast we had in any hotel worldwide with such personalised service as an added bonus
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This property has a great advantage due to its location especially when u want to be close to the business district, helps save a lot of travel time as Jakarta does have some crazy traffic...:)rooms are nice and neat with a modern touch.housekeeping staff does a good job of ensuring you get a well made out room when back from a long day at work.very good breakfast spread , offers variety of cuisines something for everyone needs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for warm welcome and great service as long as i stay in pullman jakarta , i booked 3 rooms for our family 3 days 2 night . really enjoy for Celebrate christmas eve with our family . Firstly I choose pullman jakarta because nearby with our church in thamrin residences and secondly i could go to shopping with our family with enjoy city of jakarta, it was very lit. Stay awesome pullman jakarta , ill be back 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I booked a Delicious Escape Package for 2 nights. The room is a deluxe one, and it's really nice, but when I first checked in, there is only one toothbrush. The buffet here is really great, both for breakfast and dinner. What upset me the most is the package that I booked included a 2.00 PM late check out eligibility, so I'm supposed to be able to checkout at the latest 2 PM. But, few minutes to 1 PM on checkout date, I was called by the front desk, saying that the latest checkout would be at 1 PM. They said that it was supposed to be 12 PM, but they give an extended time up to 1 PM, but after that need to pay extra charge. I've already explained that I should be eligible for 2 PM checkout, but the hotel staff didn't seem to understand that I'm actually eligible for 2 PM checkout. Really disappointing, because I paid an extra for the late checkout. I'm never going to stay in this hotel anymore, really disappointing service. But nice room though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed in this hotel several times, the hospitality makes us feel like home. Right from our feet step in until we left, everything is super. We do really love the food in Sana Sini Restaurant at Pullman Thamrin hotel, if we hadn't had a chance to stay in this hotel we always try to make it for having brunch there, which is become our favorite. All the people there are very very friendly and focus on customers, from the manager to the staff.There's one guy that is in charge to offering wine during brunch, if I'm not wrong his name is Rusli, he is so politely greeting and offering guests the drinks. Overall, this hotel is very recommended for staying during in Jakarta. We hope the management and all the people who work there can keep their good work. All the best!!!Giorgio
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Came to the hotel to try out the famous Sana Sini Restaurant. I am surprised! The food is amazing, lots of choices, and I love how welcoming and helpful the staffs are. The service wow, everyone is super kind, they communicate well, very heartwarming. Among every hotel I ever visited, this is the first time I had such impression. Keep it up! Nice hospitality 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time stay will Pullman, located very near from Bundaran HI, stayed only for 1 night and treated very nicely, check in process was smooth and staff are very friendly. Room was good, Compaq room everything I need they have it inside the room! I had very good breakfast experience at sana sini restaurant, the buffet was impressive with such a variety food. Overall this hotel was recommend either for business or leisure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed there during christmas night and room was amazing, not big but it is enough for me as I am coming with my partner. The ambience of the lobby also very light and impression. Fantastic gym and swimming pool! it made my weekend very amazing
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here 3 nights with familyThe hotel location near the Bundaran HI (HI Roundabout). There is an ongoing MRT project in front of the hotel, but it will not affect your sleep. For business travelers, beware of odd even regulations in the street as it might affect your travel schedule. This could be easily bypassed by taking a taxi i/o private carThe hotel is a member of Accor hotel chain, but the privileges of Accor Plus paid membership is not accepted here. They do accept Le Accor loyalty membership privileges. The upgraded room is a bit small for Pullman standard, but its got everything it need for a good night stay.The highlight of my stay was the Executive Lounge. They served one of the best (if not the best) social hour menu, which changed everyday. You wont need to take a dinner outside once you settled down in the Executive Lounge. The foods was fabulous and wide spread and what they regard as "Social hours - Evening Canapes" could be taken as dinner for us. Thumbs up! Being a Platinum member of Accor, I do experiences Evening Canapes at various Pullman/Sofitel/Grand Mercure, but in here, they set a new standard for it... again very good job indeed! So, consider the Executive Lounge as the place must visited during your stay here.The highest compliment to Ms. Suci, Ms. Sari and Ms. Tika in the Executive lounge for their hospitality. Sorry if I misspelled few names as the names are remembered by my 9 and 12 yo sons which impressed by their kind attention.The breakfast is very wide spread, local and international food is served. International here to be taken as Japanese, Chinese, Continental options.Will be staying here again during my next trip to Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a regular in sana sini, i always enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Always very tasty and lively. The staff is great especially the sommelier Rusdi who is super friendly... sana sini defiitely a spot to go if u look for good food 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Deae Pullman Jakarta team,Thank you very much for the nice surprise in our room, very tasty cake and your excellent service for welcoming our small family with our (Boss) Baby Boy Kenzo.We are deeply impressed about the warm-hearted hospitality. Kenzo will never forget all the lovely staff falling in love with him. Especially Auntie Cantik from Executive Lounge. We are sure Kenzo want to come back soon and give back his love to all of you .Big hug and all the best for 2018Mami Nita, Papi Markus & Boss Baby Kenzo
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s finally the end of the year and I can take some time to review some of the places and experiences from this past year. I went to Pullman with some friends some time back to explore the hotel and some of the eating options they have to offer. Sana Sini presented a tricky yet fun layout for its visitors. The food was spread out throughout the restaurant which almost forced one to wander around and explore. It was a great combination of private style areas with group style couches and some tables towards the front. Food was good, especially the cheese section, sushi stand and the mantau which was taco style. Loved it. Unfortunately my sate was a bit dry and could have been a little bit on the fresh side. Other than that Sana Sini was great. The cake shop next to the restaurant was inviting and its display of products was very eye catching. Some of its cakes were actually displayed in the lobby in glass boxes which really stood out. The Back Room Bar was stunning! Classy feel and some elegant couches towards the back. A little too much smoke for my liking but it’s indonesia so there’s no other way around it. Live music was a plus too. The lobby area boasted an open layout with a chocolate and tea shop which seemed cute and classy too. Had a great experience, and the staff at the restaurant was very welcoming. Worth mentioning I didn’t get to stay in house but will look into it for next year so I can review the room and other facilities. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed on a business trip , got an upgrade . Found the rooms to be tiny but sufficient . Very well maintained property and good cleanliness. Breakfast was good . Highly recommended for folks who want to mix shopping with business as the malls are just a walking distance 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the facilities sport in Pullman Thamrin like the sauna steam and also The gym equipment from brand Techno gym as i know is good quality.and also A lot of variety food with a nice taste at SANA SINI restaurant
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a pleasant stay in Pullman Thamrin. The room was cleaned, ambience was good and i really enjoyed my breakfast in Sana Sini Restaurant. They have all kind of breakfast and lots of varieties of food. I love their omelette, it was fluffy and good. Unfortunately i forgot to take any picture of food or even room. Thank you for Pullman Team, i will come back for sure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

its was amazing to stay here,with a friendly staf, b'fast good, and clean room, near shooping mall , realy recomended to stay, specialy for holiday ( shooping time ) i am stay in deluxe room ( realy enjoy stay at hotel room, room size more then enough )
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Because the rooms are clean, smells good, the amenities are complete, close to the city center and the hotel have good views overlooking to Jakarta's landmarks. My heart was touched when Sian helped the check in process, she was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast menu is very tasty and varied. This hotel really provides the best service, so I want to go back to stay. This hotel is highly recomended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm surprised and very happy that Pullman Hotel has a restaurant called Sana sini. With a wide range of selections of food with a good quality, good taste, good ambience and good service! As you can see our pics, we had a great time. Definitely will come back again. So, why wait?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Impeccable service from the restaurant staff, especially Rusli and Sugeng. They have made our Christmas lunch a very enjoyable one, always making sure we have what we need. Wonderful ambience, wide varieties of food, great live band performing Christmas songs. Couldn't have asked for more this! Thank you guys!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great food, nicely presented. Great atmosphere.Pak Rusli who was in charge for our table made the whole experience just perfectWe were 13 guests and each and every one left Sana Sini satisfied. We will for sure come back..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time staying at the hotel, i felt so welcome starting from the doorguy, security guard to the front liners staffs even i was the first timer guest. All the staffs were so professional, hospitable and friendly. Check in was smooth handled by miss Sian, she has a nice smile actually not only her but all the staffs and taking care of me. The guy in restaurant Imam so friendly and cheerful got greeted from his counter bar while visit the coffee shop. He was friendly to my little kid. Everything was good, room is comfort and food at the sana sini restaurant amazing. Pool and gym also peacefull. Definitely will comeback to the next visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great 5 star hotel in the heart of Jakarta.We had a wonderful stay and will surely come back.The Hotel is at the center of business distrcit and just a few minutes away from 2 large malls and as well as the well known landmark - Monas and the presidential palace.The staff were amazing and so friendly escpevially from the front desk. Overall the trip was just heavenly thanks to the hotel and will come back soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The reception who handled check in and check out was very friendly. After check in i went to Le Chocolate lobby lounge waiting for my friend. I was sitting near by the window. In the afternoon you can enjoy pianist performance.I had a breakfast at sana sini restaurant. They had a lot of varieties of menus with awesome taste. I loved their mix juices and omellete.I also spent my time at spa and wellness. I really enjoyed jacuzzi-ing. They also have two swimming pools, for adults and kids. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time stayed here, this hotel has a fancy lobby, decorated with a huge Christmas tree. The check in process is fast, soon the receptionist Ms.Dea give me the room key, and thanks to Mr.Wandaka who help me to bring my luggage into my room. I booked superior room, its very clean, spotless , good smell, but the room size is quite small, my favourite is they set up the TWG tea in the room so I can enjoy it before I sleep. The breakfast buffet is very impressive, you can find anything you want to eat here, indonesian, American,Chinese ,Japanese and many more dishes. I wish I could eat all of that delicious dishes. The pool and gym located on 2nd floor, but unfortunately I have no time to swim or work out. I will definitely come back to this hotel to enjoy all of that luxury facilities.Thank you pullman for the excellent services. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern hotel with comfortable rooms. A stunning breakfast spread, even by Southeast Asia's high standards. Almost excessive – treat it as brunch. Excellent, friendly service. Walking distance from Grand Indonesia mall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i stayed there for 7 nights, i was on business trip, my overall stay was Ok, Executive lounge staff are very friendly and professional, very limited choice of finger food and drink, even breakfast comes with very very limited options, so I started going to main restaurant for breakfast. i tried the spa, it was 10:30PM and the therapist (Dina) was bored and kept saying that she want to go home and why did i come late, so i let her go 11:30 and i paid for one and half hour, the spa is a waste of money, over all experience was Ok, i am not sure if i will come back again for this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been frequently staying in Pullman Hotel at Thamrin, Jakarta over past one year. I have found excellent service by its staff members especially Zemmy, Wulan, Dinda and Tika. Overall staying at Pullman hotel is a pleasant experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location and good hotel. I stayed only for one night in Pullman Thamrin with well appointed rooms. The hotel is 5 star in all ways which count and at a quite reasonable price. I find it more suitable for business rather than leisure travellers. The restaurant is very nice and also not too expensive. I enjoyed the great food. Lots of smiles and good service from all the staff. Overall, a fine hotel worthy of a repeat visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed in pullman hotel with my friend and we really enjoy our stay here, pullman hotel jakarta is trully special from the location, facilities, untill the food quality.The room is very clean & well maintain and the food is very tasty & a huge range of choices. Highly recommended for having stay in pullman hotel jakarta, definitely will comeback ;)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 1 night only and it was great. The lobby was amazing with a giant christmas tree. The room was good enough for you that travel alone. All employees are very friendly. The food in the restaurant is very tasty and a lot of variety. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel was nice. I stayed in a superior room with lots of facilities. There were free wifi, working desk, and a bathtub to relax after a hard day at work . The breakfast was awesome, too. They served various choices of cuisine. The waiters were very friendly, too. Totally recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in pullman for one night, all the staff there so friendly, the room was very attractive even the room relatively small, and the location of this hotel is very nice.. Near from 2 best mall in jakarta..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer: I'm an Accor Platinum member.About an hour's drive by cab from the airport, this hotel is conveniently located across the road from Plaza Indonesia and a 5min walk from Grand Indonesia malls.Shortly after entering the lobby I was whisked off to the executive lounge for checkin.Upon entering the room, I was greeted with the fresh fruit platter which is standard for platinum member.The deluxe room I had was like a mini suite with a sofa/lounge area and a separate bedroom+bath. Clean room, however the sliding door between lounge and bedroom was broken. Not an issue for me but just highlighting it.I put in a short for pressing using the express service and few hours later it had returned. No need to chase laundry for the whereabouts of my shirt.The executive lounge is quite nice and the staff really set it apart from other Pullman's in my opinion. On my second day back in the lounge, the staff remembered my preference for a table at the back corner and promptly offered me the same table.The food in the lounge is also quite decent. The breakfast and also social hour (6-8pm). For social hour I ordered sangria but the lounge was out of fruit required so the staff offered to gather it from other parts of the hotel.Overall great impression of the hotel. Not my first time here and definitely won't be my last either.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had made my booking on Accor Hotel site and had included breakfast in my reservation, however I was told during check in that breakfast is not included in my reservation. I showed the reservation confirmation which clearly indicated the breakfast. The hotel staff tried to prove me and the confirmation wrong rather than accepting the confirmation which clearly showed the breakfast.I am a regular guest of this hotel and always appreciated the service and the guest relations but this visit has left a sour taste. Though the staff accepted that there was something wrong in the hotel system and accepted to include breakfast in the end but this is not the right way to treat a loyal customer. I have tried to explain this to the staff attending me. I guess the management needs to re educate its staff. First impression matters a lot. Rest of my stay was pleasant as always.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for a few days in July, room was lovely and the staff were excellent. They even helped me with my awful mosquito bites. Restaurant is amazing, especially the breakfast buffet! I would highly recommend this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed only for one night, but it was great. From check in to check out we treated very well. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was also very clean, well designed and very pleasant. Sana Sini Restaurant is the best Buffet Restaurant ever, many kind of cuisines (Western, Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at Pullman Thamrin for 3 nights for a business trip.One morning, I had breakfast at the restaurant and left my jacket at the restaurant as I rushed off to an event. On the cab, I called the hotel for assistance.By the end of the day when I got back to my hotel, my jacket is already nicely hung in the wardrobe. Two Thumbs up.It has a great location with 2 shopping malls and customer's offices nearby!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for one night and The experience overall was wonderful and the service was fantastic The rooms were really great - the Pool side was clean. Sana sini was fantastic selection of food and excellent staff Overall a positive experience and would recommend to my colleague to stay here.Thank YouRusli
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I had amazing experience at Pullman hotel. The check in process was smooth and staff are extremely friendly and warm smile eventho it's already midnight when I arrived at the hotel. The room was well prepared, clean as I expected. Kudos for the housekeeping team...I recommended to choose a room on higher floor with resident view because it's less noisy and the green scenery that make you feel not in the center of Jakarta city. One again thank you so much Pullman 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I travel overseas on business regularly and have stayed at numerous hotels, but the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is the best yet! I can't fault it in any way at all. It's absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend staying here. Everything the Hotel has to offer is first class, but what sets it apart from all the others is the staff, who are truly amazing. They're a shining example of exemplary service and hospitality and a real credit to Accor Hotels. They deserve recognition and praise. They provide the very best service in a highly professional manner and are always happy, friendly, attentive, polite and respectful. They go beyond what is expected and take the time to make sure that each guest feels welcome and important, addressing you by your name, anticipating your needs and remembering your preferences. I was particularly impressed with the reception staff, lobby staff, security staff at the entrance of the Hotel, staff in the restaurant at breakfast and housekeeping staff. It's clear that they all take enormous pride in their job and that they are led by a management team who are leaders in the industry and an inspiration to others. Location: Great! In the heart of the Thamrin CBD, not too far from the airport and within short walking distance of two large shopping malls - Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. Rooms/bathroom - Well designed modern rooms with a large bed, choice of pillows, flat screen TV with a good choice of channels, high speed internet, desk and bathroom amenities, hairdryer, robe, slippers, iron/ironing board and safe provided. Food - Breakfast in the Sana-Sini restaurant was excellent, both in terms of selection and choice. There really is something for everyone!Fitness centre/swimming pool - Good range of equipment that is well maintained. Swimming pool is a decent size and has plenty of seating around it. Staff are available if you need them to serve food and drinks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed only for 1 night and treated very nicely. I booked 3 rooms to have short family time. They were upgraded my room and in the afternoon, they sent me chocolate in my room. What a compliment! Nice pool, nice ambience, nice staff, and nice access to big mall surrounding. Definitely will come back :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall my stay experience was excellent, staff are very friendly. Starting from front desk, sana-sini restaurant as well as kitchen staff were very helpful. Room was clean, simple design yet elegant. I had very good breakfast experience at sana-sini restaurant, the buffet here was impressive with such a variety of food in reasonable price. So far it was the biggest range of breakfast buffet I have ever seen. That's WOW.And again this is a very good hotel and recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast check in time and friendly staff, great food with comfortable ambience. I love the room because it is very clean with nice fragrance inside the room and complete facilities as well. Many choices inside the fridge.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On our way back from Ambon to Kuala Lumpur we stayed 2 nights in Jakarta at the Pullman.Check in went smooth and the room was ok.The room is relatively smallStaff at the counter were friendly and helpfulThe location of the hotel is also very nice, close to other shops and attractions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had 4 big press conference event here. The marketing sales (Merry) very helpful with all the preparation stuff. Very recommended place to you to have an event, location strategically at central Jakarta (easily to get here with car, motorbike & busway). Great! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I choose Pullman every time I stay in Jakarta for different reasons, the main one being: excellent service that makes you feel at home. For business travelers spending a bunch of time abroad this is the go-to hotel. From the security guard always welcoming you with a smile, to Rusli who adds to your dinner a good wine and a pleasant conversation or the amazing Debby, always taking care of all details to ensure you’ll have a unique guest experience, I really appreciate how every employee seems devoted to make my stay something special. I haven’t felt this genuine warmth in any other hotel.Although I travel alone I can see many families having fun at the swimming pool or enjoying the fabulous buffet at Sini Sana restaurant while the children can play in specially dedicated areas. Now to the details: 1. rooms are in excellent conditions, functional and well decorated, everything works and amenities are abundant; 2. to say that the breakfast/brunch buffet at Sini Sana is fabulous would be an understatement;3. gym, spa and pool are sizeable, with modern equipment and never had to wait for a treadmill to get free. I particularly enjoy free yoga classes on Thursdays :-)4. Function rooms are also well equipped and the staff can cater almost for every need;5. Location is perfect if you have to commute to different parts of Jakarta.In a nutshell, the location, service-orientation, friendliness of staff and quality of what you get makes this hotel the right choice for business travelers and families alike.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in Pullman Thamrin for recent business trip. It is located next to bundaran HI. Perfect location to easily access 2 malls - Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.The room was compact - 21sqm, but comfortable enough for solo traveler like me. I got special rate too! thanks to Mbak Mustika for this.. :)The interior is modern, the mattress and pillows are exceptionally super! Allow me to have quality sleep perfectly.The breakfast was great, I wrote the specific review on that.To sum up, it was a great stay in a great location.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent two weeks in this wonderful hotel. I have previously stayed at Pullman in other countries but I would say this have been the most wonderful experience . The staffs were all very friendly . Everyone of them !In particular , I need to specially mentioned several individuals that were truly outstanding : Rosli ( restaurant sommelier ) Farah, Dodo, Riski and Fidel ( all in Back Room bar). They were all so friendly, attentive and showed passion in their work. Thank you very much for making me feel right at home . You guys rock! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually i love about decoration in lobby. Beause that hotel will celebrate for chismas event. When i check in the staff so friendly. All welcomer so kindly and cherfull and best thing from this hotel is the best location in jakarta near from best mall that are plaza indonesia. And Grand Indonesia. And best hotel i’m ever staying. Best velue. Best hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

not my first time but many times i ve been here in jakarta and staying at this marvelous hotel Pullman Thamrin.Centrally located in the city.what brings me back is the friendly and professional staff.Today I ve enjoyed the wonderful buffet dinner good price value for your money.I specially want to say thanks to the sommelier for his kindness and expertise concerning of course wine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I visited this hotel on business earlier this month and was very impressed with the whole experience. The staff were very helpful and gave excellent service. The breakfast was the best I have ever seen. Not only did they have many different cuisines on offer but everything was well stocked. You need to be a bit adventurous as there is quite a bit to look at and tempt you! The in house bakery does the best pastries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

when I go to Jakarta for leisure always choosing stay in this hotel because I can reach for all my plan. I can arrange for meeting friends or family and very near to PI mall and GI mall. very exciting place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic hotel in central Jakarta with very modern roomsThe staff, especially Rio, were great and even offered access to lounge.Highly recommend for business or holiday stay.Also a fantastic breakfast on offer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start, the service here is excellent. All staff are very professional and they make you feel like a superstar. Location is superb in the city centre. The lobby of the hotel looks lovely and inviting, and the restaurant Sana Sini is highly rated. However, our stay was so-so because the rooms were quite outdated, no view (at all, we saw the hotel rooftop) and on our first night, was traumatized by the power outages that went on/off about 5+ times that night. Staff apologised as there was construction happening underground and a project by the government - it stopped the day after but it was definitely not a pleasant experience at the time. I think it may be time for a renovation of the rooms, if it were as nice as the lobby I might just come back!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been to this hotel few times this year and every time their service is excellent. Staff is very friendly and helpful especially Soleh, Rusli and Dimas. Check in was good and fast and they also help me for my late check out. Location is good, just opposite shopping mall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I use to stay here in 1989 my school holiday with my brother. the hotel name was president hotel. Still the best Destination in Jakarta. Fantastic room service was excellent since check in untill check out. huge Restaurant Sana Sini and Very good selection of wine by Vinoteca good program to be our guest by Puluhan Hotel Jakarta management hope that the hotel will be success for the future 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This weekend i had a chance to stayover with friends in Jakarta, 60kms from Bogor where i lived because we plan to go partying. After quite discussion we choose pullman thamrin as the place to stay. Why? The hotel located accross two big shopping centre in Jakarta.We checked in for only one night from saturday to sunday. Since it is categorized as five stars hotel we expected much about the hotel. The moment we step into the hotel, the huge lobby and friendly staff are welcoming us warm. Check-in was good and fast, the receptionist brief us with hotel facilities and where it is located (although we lost on our way to the pool because of no sign where should we go from the elevator, but we found it tho)The room we got was spacious. We got the grand deluxe room with street view, huge bathroom also they got shower, bath tube and closet neatly separate.We went to the pool in the afternoon to having a look and try a while. It was relaxing, afternoon dip in the pool was always a good idea. The breakfast was spectacular. Why? They have a map on each table telling you each cuisine located! The restaurant is huge and nicely decorated. I’ve been to a larger hotel restaurant but putting a map in each table is a good idea. We’ve checked out at around 1 pm and going back home from this lovely hotel.I would like to say thanks to mitha who greet us and checked us in. Thanks pullman. Surely will come again another time!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall location is good for my business trip. Location is next to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia that provide variety of foods choices after my daily work. The staff are friendly and food in Sana-sini is fresh and lots of variety to choose. The only setback is that Sana-sini no longer provide the ACCORPLUS previlage discount when dine in. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel services was great and we enjoying our room during our stay. A lot of selection for breakfast is a plus. Staff also helpful and thank you for surprise birthday gift and cake.. Appreciate it.. Well done.. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually I stay at the Mandarin or the Hyatt but the Pullman had a particularly good deal on a room so I booked that. From beginning to end this was a very good visit, from the airport meet with the car, to the unfailingly smiling service from various members of staff. The breakfast buffet is excellent in its variety with localIndonesian, Japanese (including sushi) and Chinese as well as the usual western stuff. I didn’t need to eat until the evening. The pool is large enough and quiet for a few peaceful laps. The room is pretty small (hence the deal no doubt) but was of cool design with a floor to ceiling window looking into the bathroom. The bed was comfortable - great pillows from a pillow menu - and everything was clean. Iron and board is a good thing for shorts creased from 15 hours on planes and good to see tea and coffee and two bottles of water in room are supplied. Can’t fault it, basically. There isn’t a ‘destination’ bar on a high floor (there isn’t a high floor), but that’s fine by me and the sky bar is within walking distance as is a good Indonesian top end restaurant (Seribu Rasa) and a decent Indian in the basement of the building next door (Queens tandoor). The top end shopping mall with ATM and money bureau under the grand Hyatt (and another decent bar) is opposite. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a Sunday, came to attend a function. So expected parking at this hotel to be straightforward. Unfortunately the annexe block (parking) was full all the way to the 8th floor. Lots of "reserved" empty spaces, but could not be utilized even on a Sunday. Worse thing is, why can't management put a sign up to say car park full????? Not helpful at all!!!We just kept on being asked to go to the anbexe block, and we did - twice.In the end, went for valet parking and paid the premium price. It was raining when the car was delivered, and the car was wet inside.Food was ok, facilities so so.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What a good holiday, when i stay at hotel pullman thamrin for one night. colored with elegant building design, good service, to its food as well. all excelent. I want a little review about my breakfast yesterday, where I got off the hotel room to go to where to eat. and filled with a wide selection of food choices pullman and honestly I like variant variants of its menu. meanwhile i am not forget also I was served by the staff there with their humble and courtesy I was acquainted with them until accompanied by them, they are MR RUSLI, MR SUGENG, and FAJLI who was very busy serving me to give me a food recommendations and I was very satiesfied with the pullman. if there is time back I think pullman could be the best place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall experience is great, from check in to check out.Located in the heart of Jakarta, it offer best location for business travelers.The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.The restaurant is perfect, especially the Japanese corner.I have 2 days meeting in the hotel and they also offer good meeting package.Hope to be back in Pullman in the near future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed 3 nights last week, which was a pleasant stay overall. I had a nice surprise upon arrival with a room upgrade, welcome drink and access to the executive lounge. These are real benefits we can get with the Accor membership. The buffet restaurant here was impressive with such a variety of food in a reasonable price.There are many restaurants, shopping mall and massage shops nearby and it makes this hotel most conveniently located in a traffic hell Jakarta. Staffs were kind and helpful to navigate us through all the possible options. Only one odd thing happened at the check-out: I tried to pay a part of my bill with Accor Points and was told that I should have brought a voucher to do so. I looked at the Accord website again but did not find any info related to a voucher,. I sent an email to Accor and just received an elaborate answer without a word about a voucher but that clients can use the points directly at hotel by presenting their membership card. I answered them to share this info with the hotel and am trying to share it myself by leaving this review here. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall stay experience was good, obviously due to the location that right in the central of the city.smooth check in and very friendly staffs as well, however there were several small spots on the blanket. Its not a big deal, but would great if the room maid pay more attention on it. Breakfst was excellent, highlighted at Japanese corner. Best tempura so far , the battered vegetable was perfectly done. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent location, in Central Jakarta. Very close from 2 big shopping mall in town. Staff are very friendly and helpfull from Front Desk, Room and Sana Sini restaurant. Room was clean, simple designed yet elegant. Very good breakfast experience at Sana Sini Restaurant, The buffet options are so extensive that each table even has a map to help you navigate. So far it was the biggest range of breakfast buffet I have ever seen. A very friendly and warm service from the staff as well. Amazing !!!Overall a very good hotel and recommended, especially for breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Loved it, 1970s property that was recently renovated. Spacious room, ample place to sit/write. bathroom with long bath. Also got a great haircut at the in-house salon Leo Stephen Only criticism is that the room temperature seems set at 21.5 deg and could not be adjusted, despite there being a thermostat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at this hotel for 2nd time and they were still constantly offering their excellent service. This time tried another room type at the new wing and I enjoyed a very comfortable sleep in a spacious room. Their fantastic variety of breakfast menus is also my reason to stay here again, and I found many new dishes that I didn’t see on my previous stay. No need to say about the location, since the hotel location is very strategic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent, friendly and polite service from all staff from desk to breakfast to room cleaning.Breakfast is awe-inspiring with almost every imaginable type of food. The buffet options are so extensive that each table even has a map to help you navigate. By far the biggest range I have ever seen.The basic single rooms are quite compact, and definitely not especially spacious. The design and decor is clearly aimed to maximise light and the impression of space though, so it’s not oppressive.The bathroom of this room type has a full height window into the bedroom which could be a little disconcerting, although there is a blind for the self-conscious.Overall a very good hotel and recommended, especially for breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rusli my wine waiter is fantastic. Best afternoon. The wine and seafood buffet is unbelievable value. Lobster , prawns , sushi. So much to eat and enjoy. Quality wine service by our wine waiter Rusli. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great food, great service very friendly atmosphere. A+++Came for sunday brunch with family and girlfriend the food is amazing. All the people are super friendly and great service.Well recommended a++ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I travel often for business mainly in the UK but this time a new partnership required me to travel to Jakarta.The hotel is in a superb location, right in the centre and next two to major shopping malls. Staff are extremely friendly and after check-in they send me Camomile tea to the room with a card saying "Rest well after your long journey" - truly amazing, never happened to me in any other hotels - THANKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent location to beat the traffic jam situation in Jakarta. Very good breakfast spread and wide selection to choose from.Clean and modern rooms. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Would highly recommend to business Travellers. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had amazing stay in this hotel. Location wise at central of the town , food was excellent toward all their restaurants( we tried 3 spots - bfast room, lobby lounge and bar) . My highlighted for sure , are their staffs who really patient with our requests. We went there as part our wedding venue survey and I am amazed with the options of their venues that we can consider for our small intimate city wedding next year. I just found out that they have this rooftop area we can strongly consider as my future venue
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep doing good maintenance in order to rise your Star Reputation is part of service and hospitality. Need to support the technical matter, replacing out of order tool’s facility to be able to work properly as a standard of 5 Star Hotel & Resort under Accors Hotel Brand. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice Hotel in the Centre of Jakarta, easy access from the mainroad. I stayed here not just because my husband had a meeting, it’s because The Chocolate Lounge is so unique. All the staff is so responsible, they know what we need. Thanks to Pak Hari from Buffet Restaurant, Ibu Jahara who suggest the best choice of bread, and Adinda for super fast check in. What a lovely experince! Keep it up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was come to pullman because my friend sait that it was a good hotel to get relax in the middle of central jakarta.and also it was near grand indonesia and plaza indonesia made my holiday become super fantastic, i only need to take a walk cross the street through the bridge to get to the mall.And what amaze me that the breakfast was completely made me satisfied with all open kitchen from western, japanese,chinese,indonesian also.good job pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here more than 10 times now. Great location, great food and great service.. normally. This time i was dissatisfied that the room I got was extremely hot and the a/c wasnt working and i made 3 complaints to the front office and no one attempted to even check or update me or change my room.. My 2 nights stay was as you can imagine... sweaty due to the heat. Very poor this time Pullman. May consider other hotels after this. 2/10
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in central Jakarta, Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia juts across the hotel can be reach within 10min walk, but don't walk alone if you are alone ladies. I booked for the room with city view, end up i have the room at 6th floor which is not really city view because there is a road construction work progress in front of the hotel.Love the room colours, complete amenities provided, comfort bed, fast check in and check out, good security inside hotel.The only thing i feel not good enough is the breakfast, there are plenty of choices but the taste not so delightful, with the amount of money we paid it should be better. Small swimming pool.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in the hotel to attend a friend's wedding nearby and I loved every minute of it!The breakfast at the hotel is amazing and set up in different small stands, so you have the feeling like the options never stop. I stayed 4 nights and had a different breakfast every day :). Chef Cameron was very friendly and helpful, as were the other staff members.The location of the hotel is fantastic if you need to be in the business district of Jakarta and/or want to go shopping in one of the huge shopping malls across the hotel.When we stayed there, they were working on the street in front of the hotel, which made it a bit more difficult to access the hotel, but that will probably improve quickly.The rooms are very comfortable and equipped with everything you expect from a Pullman. As we had a very late flight back, we were very happy that we could get a late check out!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I had a most enjoyable stay at Pullman Thamrin, most notably the staff were some of the best I have experienced in my travels, the staff in the Bar ensured our late afternoon was relaxing, Dinda in the Lobby was very helpful when i wanted to take a trip to Bogor and Rusli in the Restaurant has great knowledge of wines.all in all a very enjoyable stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located in the heart of the city with shopping avenues all around... the rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was majestic... one of the largest breakfast spread I have seen... shower in the room was broken else the place deserves a 5 star review
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this divine hotel and my stay was wonderful. They say that first impressions count and my very first thought was how impressed I was with all of the staff, including the security staff at the front door, which is a very reassuring experience. The Reception area’s decor was lovely and very classy. The room was also very well designed and very pleasant, with all of the guests’ needs being catered for, including an iron and ironing board, a safe, which are located within a generously sized walk in wardrobe, tea making facilities and a bar fridge. I could have stayed there for a much longer time had I have had the chance. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I travel a lot for business and when I do, I try to stay in hotels that treat me like family and take care of my needs. At the Pullman Jakarta, this is exactly what I found. The hotel was very clean, the rooms comfortable and the service fantastic. I would especially like to point out the service at the hotel restaurant - this was probably the best service that I have ever received and sets the bar very high when comparing future hotels. The people were fantastic!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow. This breakfast buffet is HUGE! It literally has a map on each table - Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, Western, Healthy, French etc. Gone are the days where an omelette guy is enough. This place sets a new bar, complete with great seating options. But I digress. The rooms are tiny, so upgrade if you can. The bath is miniature but yet requires a step ladder to get in it. The bed is super comfortable. And the rest of the service is good. Nice for a couple of nights.. worn out after 4 though. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very friendly staff. Amazing breakfast for every taste. Always nice and clean prepared room thanks to DianGood facilities gym and pool.Enjoy to stay here very much. Come here again next time in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm welcome, good quality service...recommended for family, company, and friend to tray at sana sini restaurant. Special to Pak Sugeng and team thank you very much for your supporting to my daughter birthday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You get all the bells and whistles and then some. The yukata was a very nice touch and makes a lot of sense since it used to be a Japanese-owned hotel. The breakfast has Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, Western cuisine and is on until 11am so that means you can essentially have brunch there everyday. It's my first hotel of choice when going to Jakarta.Had three power interruptions at night, though, but the power came up a minute or two after it failed each time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time I stay in Pullman Thamrin and it was a really well spent weekend with my family, the room is quite fair for the price and liked the interior design. For the breakfast, I think Sana Sini has very diverse & complete food selection, the service was fast with Pak Sugeng & Pak Safa really assist me well. Me & my family think will stay in bigger room next time in Pullman Thamrin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located about an hour drive from the airport.It is a grand 4.5 or 5 stars hotel with modern decorations & facilities. The hotel staff are great - helpful and friendly without lacking of smiles on their faces. Checking in was quick & the staff manning the check-in counter was very helpful .The room is excellent - it is fully carpeted & well maintained. The furniture (closet, working desk, sofa etc) has the new look & well maintained by the staff. The bed, pillows & comforter are very comfy - you'll definitely get a good night sleep. The lighting in the room is good & adequate. The toilet has shower & bathtub. The towels provided are soft & comfortable. Amenities provided are sufficient for day use. Overall, the room & bath room are very well maintained & clean. You can refer to the photos that I uploaded. There are iron & iron board in the room. The hotel provided complimentary water bottles and tea/coffee. There's a minibar in the room.The breakfast buffet is excellent with wide selection of food. There are many stations for different kind of cuisines. You'll definitely enjoy the breakfast here. Please refer to some photos that I uploaded. We also ordered a room service for dinner. Took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive. The food are prepared nicely & tasty with reasonable price.Internet connection (wifi) provided is very good & fast.The hotel is very secure. All cars need to go through security check before being allowed in the compound. Guests will also need to go through metal detector & baggage scanner before being allowed in the hotel. The floors button in the elevator can only be pressed with the room key/card.The hotel outlook, decorations, surrounding & the staff are excellent. In my opinion, the room & the stay are worth the value of the room rate.We'll definitely will stay at this hotel again if visiting Jakarta in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed in both Pullman hotels in Jakarta. But the recent one I was staying at the one in Jalan Thamrin.I like the hotel very much, from the location, the friendly staff and the welcoming ambiance the hotel gives from the moment you entered the hotel lobby.The room itself is very nice and comfort. I went up to 15th floor to Una Bar. The view you can get from there is beautiful especially at night where you can see Jakarta is like city of light.The last but not least, their buffet restaurant -Sana Sini- where you can get both yummy European and Asian food selection.My overall stay at Pullman Hotel Jakarta was nice and I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From the welcome by name at the front door, to the friendly send off in my taxi, I felt very welcome in the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. The Executive guest room is spacious, very comfortable and well appointed. The Executive Lounge is a comfortable and quiet space to relax. The range of food for the evening cocktail hour has reduced in scope over recent months although the quality is still very good. The service and quality in Sana Sini restaurant did not disappoint. I will certainly be returning to this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am an Accor member and used the executive lounge. My room is fabulous - comfortable and spacious. It provides a good work space. The lounge is well appointed with a great range of delicious food and friendly staff who are attentive to my needs. As a female travelling alone I feel safe and well looked after in a well appointed environment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 17 days at pullman Thamrin and they have blowed me away!! Fantastic breakfast with fresh vegetable juices, clean gym and shower room, just made me feel at home.Special thanks for having warm welcome from Ibu Rerry - Director of Sales and all staffs (reception, doorman, housekeeping, gym staffs,etc) made me feels like i''m part of the family.The housekeeping maid even know which part of the bed I usually sleep, what kind of tea that I drink in the room and the most fantastic experience was to remind me to drop my laundry, if I forgot to drop it at my usual time, Its was like having your mom remind you for every single things. I had amazing experience and will definitely recommend the hotel for anybody who have any business trip to jakarta. One thing for sure, my company already know that this is will be my preferred hotel for my next trip.Last but not least, the location also very near from Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia... just 3 mins walk and you can enjoy shopping and having good meal too thereToyota Financial Services / Johny 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here last weekend with the Accor's Weekend Rush promotion pricing. For that price, I found my stay to be of a very great value.Check-in was fast and smooth, great presentation with the envelope containing the key cards and welcome drink vouchers, giving the feeling of luxury. I don't think I received this presentation when I stayed at Pullman Central Park Jakarta. Thumbs up for Dhea who assisted us on our check in.We got upgraded to one level up for the room, so I'm not quite sure what's the name of the room. However, the room is spacious with comfortable bed and selection of pillows just a phone call away. The bathroom is, sadly, small and you'd feel cramped inside the bathroom. Also one thing that can be a let down is that the hotel is feeling a little aged by now. Buttons for the lights in the room and the corridor on the hotel room floor is the witness for this hotel's age. However, the staff responsiveness and their quality of service make up for the hotel's age.Buffet dinner was great , there are tons of selection, I recommend anyone staying here to try their buffet dinner, it's a great way to try many taste the hotel catering have to offer. Breakfast was also great.If you are staying here in the near future, just a little note that the rooms facing the main Thamrin street can be a little bothersome during the day due to the fact that Jakarta is building the MRT so during the day you will hear the construction noise. Maybe rooms not facing the main street would be better.And also, the hotel's location might be a little troublesome during weekdays since they are located inside Odd-Even Car License Plate restrictions. Overall, I have no major complaints and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Jakarta. I would stay here again in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had group lunch at the hotel last week, and the food was excellent. they have so many food counters, and my favorite was chinese food area. The chef was very friendly. I think his name wong. A very cheerfull guy. I would suggested people to have lunch in the hotel because its worthed. Another plus poin, was the staffs at the lobby, are very smiley.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose to stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia since it's located close to Japan Embassy. I love the bed, it's very comfortable and the breakfast was perfect, a lot of food selection. The staffs at breakfast were amazing. Hands up for them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed at pullman thamarin Jakarta and was fortunate to get lounge access and the staff where wonderful especially Tika who gave me some great ideas on touring Jakarta. Also the food in the exec lounge is perfect.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time staying at pullman and its feel like i'm at home. Everybody so welcoming especially the reception ms. Sian. My highlight will be the breakfast. It was excellent until i even put another review onlu for the restaurants. Its a must to book a room with the breakfast. I don't think one day its enough. Next time i will book another room type because the superior room quite packed for us.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really liked the hotel the crew was very welcoming and I would like extremely thank housekeeping Cepi and Wanda if I remember because they helped us with the facility's when we ask and they were very smiley, moreover the rooms were clean 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here over the weekend for one night to celebrate my wife's birthday. From the moment I requested for special birthday arrangement, to the moment that we check-out, the hotel never fail our high expectation. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast in Sana Sini Restaurant were great, lots of food to choose from. We went to Executive Lounge for afternoon tea and they got excellent tea brand. The Grand Deluxe room is huge. The toilet, shower and bathtub are seperate with each other. Overall the service and it's facilities are five stars! Special thank you for Fransisca, Debby and Filipus for organising this special moments. We definitely will be back. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

They have the best location, best food and amazing service. Room was spacious, very well maintained and spotless. The staff went above and beyond to ensure your comfort. This hotel will definitely be my first option next time I come visit Jakarta. Totally worth it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My stay in PJI had been a very satisfactory one. Positive : - staff very friendly and accomodate, - food at breakfast room are abundant, - easy to walk here and there - plus point is on sunday, the car free day just right at the front of the hotel. a must thing to do , since the hawker vendors offers loads of foods. Negative : - parking area limited and quite expensive for outsider. My friend picked me up and he need to paid at least 5000 rupiah for 5 minutes for drove from the entrance gate to the lobby. Kinda redicilous .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed for 3 nights & really enjoyed this hotel, great room, great breakfast, great staff. We would go out each day & when we came back we would always find the lobby cool & welcoming, everyone smiling welcoming us back, so nice!We had breakfast every day & it was amazing so many choices & such friendly staff, dinner one night was fantastic too.Will stay here again for sure!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just what you expect from a pullman. Huge breakfast buffet with so much choice, great coffee, food location If you need cash there is an ATM in the building next doorNice roomsPool is also nice but has limited access time 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel staff were truly world-class, speak English, and helpful and polite. The breakfast buffet was amazing, with a spread going from egg Benedict to authentic Indonesian dishes. The only thing I found lacking was a juicer which I usually take at breakfast. `Juices' were just fruit blended with water, not extracted juice.As for the room, after checking into the huge reception area one gets a shock when entering the tiny room. For a 2,221,787 Rupiah a night hotel, it was truly disappointing. Worst of all was the bath: One showers in a miserable cubicle 3 ft X 5 ft, with a roll up blind on the right and a nasty plastic curtain on the left!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had the pleasure of staying at this location. I must say they left me wanting for nothing. True hospitality. I was visiting friends and also had a couple of business meetings as well. My first time in Jakarta and Pullman will definitely be a regular for me on my future visits. The young lady, Debbie who greeted me and assisted me to my warm reception upon check-in was most welcome. Food was great...My room was nice as well. I recommend this property for business travelers as it is centrally located in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very nice 5-star hotel located at Jakarta's prime area with excellent service provided by hotel staff!Within walking distance to the most wonderful shopping mall in Jakarta, Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.Room is perfect with modern design.Breakfast was soooo extensive and delicious. Bravo to restaurant team!I will definitely coming back to this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Conveniently located at the heart of Jakarta- Well equipped rooms with lots of facilities within the room and hotel- Not so good executive lounge - Friendly and patient staff- Superb breakfast options even for guests who intend to stat long
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for only one night but was impressed ,friendly check-in made me feel was welcome. The room was quite small but good designed. For breakfast was a lot of variety, cozy place, specially on omelet station chef Ari and chef Hendro very friendly and helpfull to make my special request omelet. Nice to stay in Pullman Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was upgraded to VIP to my pleasant surprise. Room was great, excellent service and staffs were absolutely helpful and friendly. Amenities were great too, made the work trip all the more enjoyable. Location was fantastic too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my 3rd stay (5 nights) at this hotel in and Executive Room with access to the lounge. I requested a quite room on a high floor and this is exactly what I got. The also check me in early. The lounge is very good and the lounge staff, a big thank you. The hotel staff is very honest. I left an airline toothbrush pack in the room because I do not need it and did not want to put it in the bin. Upon my return I received an email that they found this item. I explained that I left intentionally. The restaurant is good to. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for only one night, but memorable. Check in and check out process was very quick. The room, although it's quite small but very well designed. I love the color combination in the room. Nothing more to say but a very well sleep experience here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Jakarta is located right in the "middle" of the action being relatively easy to access from the airport and just off the "roundabout". Two major shopping malls are just over the road from the Hotel. After passing through a thorough and well managed security inspection the large, open foyer and friendly Check-in staff made us feel most welcome. We were booked into one of the newer sections of the Hotel; our room was spacious, well appointed, Wi-Fi was free an easy to access, the bathroom had a "tall shower" and very modern facilities. The large bed dominated the room but still we had plenty of space for ourselves and our belongings. The hotel had an excellent gymnasium, pool and spa. Even from the first day all the staff we met around the Hotel greeted us by name; all very impressive. By our normal standards the tariff was very reasonable. A Hotel that is easy to recommend. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great week end , the perfect getaway week end right in the city center. There is a large variety of F&B and they do a very good Sunday brunch by the pool . Staff are amazing, location spot on, rooms have everything you need, plus the shopping centre with so many great shops would keep a shopaholic busy for days is right across the building . The staff all look after us like family, this is the place to go if you want top service!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is in the best location for anyone travelling to Jakarta for business or leisure right on Thamrin. I have stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, my room was great and the Executive Lounge staff were extremely helpful and friendly and one evening they even assisted me with printing and reformatting documents. Can highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in a very strategic area with great value compare to other hotels surrounding. Bed and pillow is so fluffy, makes you want to stay longer and won't wake up hahahaha. Room is amazing. Breakfast with extensive selections. Definitely a very recommended hotel in Central Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On a business trip, I walked into the hotel in evening expecting to check in and call it a day. Was pleasantly surprised that I have received a room upgrade, on the high floor with a fantastic view. In the room there were chocolates, fruits and cookies which were a refreshing treat. Made my stay wonderful .--Thank you team
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I went there with my small family for a personal Visit. They gave us pleasant surprise by choosing us as Vip of the day guest. We got to experience the vip longue. We also got discount in all outlet! This is by far the most pleasant trip that I had so far! Thank you Pullman! It wont hurt if you choose me again as vip of the day for my next visit on November!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a flawless stay at the Pullman Jakarta. Check in went smooth by a very friendly front desk staff member. They have given me a VIP status which has resulted in an upgrade to a Grand Deluxe room and access to the Executive lounge. The room and bathroom were large, very comfortable and very clean. Breakfast and dinner were outstanding. All staff were extreme friendly and helpfull. Location is near Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia.This will be my go to hotel in Jakarta. Thank you all for a wonderfull and excellent stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a very pleasant stay @ The Pullman Thamrin over the weekend. Front desk staff was prompt and pleasant, it was a smooth check in for me. The hotel lobby was nicely decorated and gave a very impressive impression. The new room is definitely a huge plus point and it felt very comfortable in the room. Overall i would definitely return back to this hotel if i am in Jakarta again. Thank you team!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Such a very memorable experience , start from very homey and warm welcome receptions, with very clean & fresh room, a very spot viewing from window direct to very iconic bunderan HI jakarta, very helpful housekeeping staff that i can feel for 24hours , and very outstanding breakfast experience from sana sini restaurant who has completely menu and beverage, the pool was open air with green fresh trees, sauna & jacuzi was so relaxing , overall PULLMAN is the best hotel in town to stay, very recommendable, keep it up for all the staff, one word AWESOME . 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room was big, the executive lounge was quiet and well appointed. The hotel has several restaurants, so it was easy for me to choose which outlets that I want to use for all my meetings. The highlight from this stay was of course their staff. They go above and beyond to ensure your request completed. Well done for the management. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff were superb, very good check-in/out. Service with a smile. Really great location for central Jakarta this highly advisable. Compared to other hotels in the area this Pullman was great value and very helpful.Well done to the people running this hotel. Will return here on next trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The new tower's room definitely has bigger space compare to the previous room I stayed before. The small gift given in the evening placed on the bed was a great touch. Breakfast spread was amazing like other reviewer mentioned. There is some construction in the main road, however its not noisy at all since at evening, they will stop the work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Service very good, recommended to book this hotel again, complete breakfast menu from western to asian, Clean and complete bathroom amenities, lot of space to park the car, overall I'm satisfied stay at pullman thamrin
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is a bit old fashioned but the staff is outstanding friendly and welcoming.The rooms are small, furniture some years old, cleanness could be improved too. The breakfast is just huge, but size isn’t everything. Food is partly cold or laying on the table for a while.But everywhere the staff is extremely nice. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What a fantastic food experience! A very MUST visit if you're looking for the super-nice sunday brunch in Jakarta! Nice atmosphere with accoustic music. Professional waiters. Amazing foods with too many choices. Really love this place for its fresh oysters from Sumbawa, and of course the scallop! It was absolutely stunning! All the best I've ever had. Will come again!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was such a good things that pullman offer such a dark side room so i dont have to wake up early while im too hangover hahaha but again the bathroom was good with good size of bathub and also fluffy bed! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgraded to Grand Deluxe room, clean, cozy and large room. Very helpful and nice people. Excellent food in Sana Sini restaurant. Wifi connection is perfect. Located in the center of the Jakarta city. ...................................................................................................................................................
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was staying on july, Room was small but yet enough for me as single traveller. Bfast selection was excellent. I love the japanese corner.I dont realize that i left one of my special sock in the room until the hotel sent me reminder email It was very thoughtfull yet impressing for me, obviously i will stay again in this hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the hotel for the first time and I was amazed with the quality of the services and the room. I like the way the hotel staff welcome guests and the personalised gesture inside the room.I used to stay in similar quality hotels before, but the experience I had in Jakarta was exceptional. I felt the professionalism in every details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the third Pullman hotel I stay in SEA and so far is the best one based on my experience. The staff are friendly as always, especially the club lounge staff. Food is delicious and bed are comfortable, definitely worth to stay here!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was first time I stay in a Pullman hotel and I've coming to Jakarta for the last three years! How come did I not stay here before? Definitively a must in my very next . The staff enjoys if you enjoy which is the very best expression of people who really put his will to make your stay as if you would be at home. Regarding the services needless to say they are excellent and about food you have a wide selection of different types and diets. Superb! One tip: If you come to know Mr. Rusli at the restaurant you might enjoy a good convesation with him about wines and cheese. That made me feel as being in Spain where I am from.Thanks to all the team. You do a daily great job!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The selection of menu is very complete. From europe to asia. Nice and warm service. Also i love the menu the dessert. They serve so many brand new taste for ice cream. Good and strategic location. Perfect for business also for family⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My third stay at this establishment. The superior location was matched with the highest level of service. Staff is literally one phone call away, with excellent problem solving skills. This is definitely my go-to hotel in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best of the Pullman is here .. If you haven't met Ms. Sian, you have missed the most charming and most beautiful and most helpful staff of Pullman ... If you haven't met Miza, you haven't tasted the best cocktail of Jakarta ... This is an awesome place .. wanna be here again and again .. Thank you all the staff for wonderful hospitality, the best breakfast spread and the perfectly sized rooms ... Sian and Miza are added advantages ... Cheers !!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice and clean rooms, quite spacious too. Front desk and concierge staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast spread was amazing! Have not had such a good buffet breakfast in a while. I also tried the spa, gym and salon - all were above expectations. I'd also like to commend the staff here who went out of their way to help me with some errands early in the morning - will most definitely return to Pullman Thamrin again :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin always is a good experience. From the friendly staff to the clean and comfortable room we cannot say nothing. The breakfast still the best in Jakarta. The location is fantastic, easy shopping and night activities. And if are a Le club member, free late check out and room upgrade. Perfect. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed in the Pullman Hotel for one night and it was perfect. The staff are warm, welcoming and helpful. The facilities are also great. The Sunday brunch which includes unlimited wine and/or processco refills was delicious. The food variety is very impressive and unlike what we have seen in Singapore before. Our waiter in the restaurant was very nice and friendly, he made our experience even better. The band who played were also great, we really enjoyed their songs. We definitely recommend Pullman and would always come back for the Sunday brunch when in Jakarta next! Many thanks for a great stay! (Neil, Mads, Simon, Joe, Sam, Mark)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A great choice and much more reasonably priced than most in this zone. Fully equipped gym great large pool and Grand Deluxe Rooms in new wing were very spacious and new. Thank you for such a nice welcome and stay to the foyer and reception staff! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is indeed amongst the best hotels in jakarta. We celebrated our 10th anniversary here. A few of the staff will remember your name. Grand deluxe rooms are huge with separate bath and shower. Tv can be heard through speaker in bathroom. Wonderful views of plaza indoensia mall. But be aware there is alot of construction taking place directly infront of the hotel expected to last till 2018.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When we first arrived I was told I had been chosen as their VIP guest for the day! We were given a room upgrade, access to the executive lounge and discounts on all restaurants in the hotel. I had arrived completely exhausted from a stressful week at work and felt very pampered during our two day stay. The service, food and hotel atmosphere was impressive at all times. The next time I need to relax and feel pampered I will definitely return to Pullman Jakarta Indonesia!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed there recently and had a really good time. Amazing staff, excellent service, great location! Rooftop bar was simply mesmerising! Couldn’t have found anything better! Definitely recommended! Would very certainly go there again! 5*
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The people, the service, the location, the room, the VIP treatment and the extensive buffet makes this hotel your choice in Jakarta! I will come back to Pullman on my next business or pleasure trip. Try the Macaroons from the bakery on the first floor.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have had another enjoyable and memorisable stay with Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. Hotel staffs from welcome greeter, to front desk and restaurants have made my stay amemoriabke one. From the first step into the hotel , I feel welcome and comfitable. Services at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is excellent with great services. As a Le Club Platinum Accor member, I have been offered Early check in and late check out until 5pm, Free welcome drink voucher, VIP treatment, free utilisation of the executive lounges and room upgrades. The staffs from front desk, welcome greeter, executive lounge and SanaSini restaurant all remembered me from my regular stay. Rooms are great, clean and comfy. With welcome food and drinks available when I checked into the room. However, the bathroom amnesties kits has changed from Bigelow brand to no brand bathroom amnesties kits. This is the shortfall of the hotel after I have stayed in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia many times. I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia during my birthday last two month in July and I am impressed with the services as the hotel do remember my birthday. I was presented with a Chocolafe mousse cake which taste nice and the hotel welcome guest have greeted my happy birthday when delivering the cake to my room. Breakfast and dining experience at SanaSini restaurant is perfect. I would like to praise Ms. Marlina for her professional and friendliness. Myself and friend feel welcome and comfortable with Marlina and her colleagues at SanaSini. I would like to say well done to Marlina in providing the excellent service during my visits to SanaSini Pullman. Visit to the executive lounge is a must when I am staying with Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. The team at the lounge made me feel so welcome during my visits. The menu have a variant everyday ranging from Chinese, Japanese and Indonesia menu to order during the social hours 6pm- 8pm. Unfortunately, the staff named Ms. Angel have left the job and have been replaced by Ms. Wulan. Ms. Wulan have not been really friendly but was sarcastic during my check in process. Overall, my stay was a memorable and enjoyable one and would definetly recommend to all my friends and will stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia for my next visit to Jakarta. Well done Pullman Jakarta Indonesia (bathroom amnesties kit should be Bigelow and no others).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at this hotel during my recent business trip last week. Security is tight, rooms are clean , staff are amazingly courteous and best breakfast buffet spread I have tried in all hotel stays previously.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is always great to stay at Pullman Jakarta. We stayed in a Grand Deluxe Room in a new tower. The room is spacious and clean, try the pillow menu and you will love it. The food in Sanasini Restaurant have many variety, value for money!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I enjoyed my 2 days stay at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. The room was very nice and comfortable and the serivce excellent. I will come back next year for my next visit. Maybe then I will have more than 2 days to enjoy the amanities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I had the Sunday buffet lunch last weekend and was pleasantly surprised that the standard and range of food options had improved from our last visit there (and our last visit was excellent). They had added great dishes like Singapore Chili Mud Crab and Tom Yum soup to their already expansive food options and the staff were always checking on our drinks situation. Easily the best Sunday brunch going on in Jakarta - in a town where every hotel has one. Good job.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room is very clean and housekeeping perfect.Housekeeping Dian very helpful and so kind.There are many varieties available for breakfast.The location is easy to access every where.The pool is very clean.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It has great location but for me, as a 5-stars hotel it should have larger room. When I was trying to boil water, the electric kettle doesn't work, I called front desk to get replacement, thank to responsive staff. The breakfast was good, it has various menu. Special credit for Japanese menu, its delicious and have good authenticity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin has been my hotel of choice for my trips to Jakarta over the last several years. I go away each time simply impressed at their high standards of service. And it was no different this time. Right from the reception, the many hotel staff are there to politely help you with language or directions for taxis, and the other things a visitor needs such as foreign exchange. As for my room, though I found to be a bit small, its 5-star quality amenities made up for the size. It was crispy clean everyday after I return from work. Now, they even have a menu of pillows for you to choose, from down feather to super fiber, etc. The wifi was also good. Not to be missed is the breakfast buffet, which was really fabulous with choices such as Western, Japanese, Indonesian, and even specials of the day like Spanish omelette. Too bad I only had an hour for breakfast before going to work. What I like about Pullman is also that it is close to 2 big malls that are just a couple of minutes walk away. There are lots of restaurants and good shopping. So, Pullman is a perfect choice for my 3-4 days trip to Jakarta. No question that I'll pick Pullman again the next time I visit. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So far they has never failed on delivering great customer service during my stays.Friendly and attentive front desk staff, staff at lounge is also friendly and always with smile, very approachable when you requires help and information.Room is clean and bed is comfortable. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a great meeting over the past five days at Pullman Hotel & Resorts Jakarta. it is a wonderful place because this hotel is located in central Jakarta and very close to my office (Oil Centre Building) hihi :) and I have to tell you that before I booked a meeting room in this hotel, I was so confused because I have a deadline, my boss ask me to reserve meeting room for five days in last minute :( so I tried so hard haha I started to call Hotels in Jakarta that near to my office and Pullman Hotel & Resorts Jakarta was my choice and that was the best choice hahha. a Sales Marketing (Bu Merry) was so helpful, she was very a good sales lady, she helped me a lot, u're incredible bu Merry. the food was amazing, I felt like I was lunch & dinner in heaven hahah, Everyone was happy with the food, the venue is perfect, the operation team (Mas Aris & Mas Putra) so helpful too, he always there to serve us. The team were extreamly helpful. We would love to work with you again in the future. thank u for everything, it was a successful event.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this hotel in September 2017. I found the room size to be small but it was comfortable enough for a single person. Their food was great. Staff was courteous and very helpful. I didnt understand whenever the taxi came to pick you up or drop in the hotel 5000 rupiah was charged. I really liked the food at this hotel. I had a short and comfortable stay at this hotel. I might not stay again at this hotel due to room size.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice CBD area hotel. You can acees to 2 popular shopping mall for dinining and shopping.Mass transit is under construction then you have to prepare your time for any business.Secure and safety for any business tripper.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I frequent this hotel and for the first time I got to try out the new wing which was newly renovated. The rooms are noticeably nicer and as a LeClub Gold member I get upgrades, welcome drinks, and they setup biscuits, macarons and sparkling water on my desk.This hotel has one of the best gyms I've been to as well.Location is great, across the road from Plaza Indonesia, and though you can easily walk over a footbridge, I admit I've caught a taxi to cross the road a few times.Service and food is all good, as they held my lost property until I re-visited within the month.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I checked in Pullman for one night. The room was great, the breakfast spread was impressive and nothing short of ambitious. Love the blue batik robe in the room. I wanted to buy it but didn't ask if it was on sale. If I'm in Jakarta again, I'd book this hotel for the staff's friendliness and excellent service. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stopped over here with my partner on my way home and from the moment we walked in all the staff were so lovely and happy to assist. We dined in the restaurant in the night and the food was exceptional and our waiter recommended a lovely bottle of red. Looking forward to our next return. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at the pullman for a few days as a small getaway and was blown away from start to finish!Firstly, the location couldn't be more ideal, for business or leisure, everything you need is within walking distance.The hotel lobby is breathtaking with high ceilings and a funky modern design! Perfect place for a coffee in the morning to energise you for the day ahead. The room followed the same funky modern design as the lobby and had plenty of space and gorgeous views of the city.I'm lucky enough to be a gold member with Accor, so was granted access to their executive lounge. I've stayed in many hotels around the world, many of them with executive lounges, but this one had a major difference! The staff! Polite, friendly, courteous, every member of the executive lounge team went above and beyond their duties to make everyone feel as if they were part of the family! Pullman Jakarta, thank you so much for an incredible stay and can't wait to see you again soon!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Frequent visitor to this hotel for business trips. The best thing about the hotel is the staff seem ever motivated and over the stays they seem to be able to continuously improve and outdo their service. Hotel staff across the board are professionally trained, provides friendly service and constantly looking out to meet the guest needs...Location is good, just opposite two major shopping malls and have plenty of access to taxis just outside the street. Rooms are slightly on the smaller side for the superior range but clean and well maintained Overall experience provides great value for money in this key area of Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Breakfast buffet is to die for and I would definitely stay in that hotel again just to relive the experience. Amazing variety and quality.We were upgraded to the Suite, which was very spacious, but a bit tired (bathroom was lovely though). If you want a nicer room, ask to be allocated in the new wing.Very kind, helpful staff and great location, in the middle of everything.Some people here complain about the noise from Thamrin road -- it was not audible on the top floor, so being high up is the way to go.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Its always a good experience staying at this hotel but on this particular trip, it was great. First, the front office folks was able to accommodate my request to delay my original bookings to 45 days due to workload commitments. Second, I was having dinner at the lobby cafe (Sana Sini...) and was sitting right next to the wine area. I was attended to by the best waiter - Rico (if I remember correctly). Exceptionally attentive and always asking if I needed anything or suggesting if I have tried any cuisines offered by the buffet. Overall, this has sealed the deal for a great experience...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a nice evening after a long plane ride and taxi ride. Pak Rusli at the Sana/Sini restaurant was very hospitable and had excellent wine selection on offer and was also the perfect embodiment of Indonesian kindness by complementing the wine with a little cheese gratis! Definitely the best hotel experience in Jakarta to date after many years of coming here. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good room good staff good service good location good restaurant sow many varieties for menu foods near the malls good western food vary helpful tha staff good spa swimming pool good gym good masage thanks for service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My previous write up about a Pullman hotel was less than flattering due to the fact that I was left uninspired. This Pullman has managed to change my mind about the brand completely. A blend of eccentricities, awesome customer experience and quality products in every facet off its being is what makes this hotel great. The rooms are stunningly well appointed and very comfortable. The buffet is out of this world and provides a feast from all corners of the globe to savour. All in all I couldn't fault this hotel as I really enjoyed my stay.Well done team!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We always stay at this hotel when visiting family in Jakarta and as always, perfect! Service has always and still is great and the staff so very helpful and welcoming. Great location with malls a quick hop across the road. The breakfast, oh my, brilliant - with every food option going.I am sure we will be visiting next year so see you again soon!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for two weeks for work and was so happy to return each night to the Pullman. The only thing I loved more was waking up every day to the best breakfast buffet I've ever had! Service is incredible and everyone goes out of their way to remember your name and what you like. Special shoutout to Fajli for introducing me to ginger coffee. Looking forward to returning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I love everything about this hotel! From the room to the foods. They have a complete package. Their location is in the heart of Jakarta, right across the famous fountain. You can observe the city that never sleeps through your window at nite. The bathroom is also nice and clean.If you have no idea for NYE, book a room in this hotel and enjoy the fireworks and the crowds from your room. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thamrin Pullman is well situated for most everything that one would want to do whether for business or pleasure. The staff are extremely attentive and they make you feel very welcome. The rooms, facilities and the service is top notch and i have not had and unpleasant experiences during any of my regular stays. Well done everyone at Pullman Thamrin. You certainly will always have my business.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I arrived after a long haul flight, feeling very unwell and this hotel provided a very welcome refuge in which to recover. I had booked a Grand Deluxe room which was very spacious, spotlessly clean and had every accessory I could of possibly needed. The staff were lovely, very friendly and polite, and I was impressed by how many greeted me by name during my stay. I used the in-room dining during my stay and found the service excellent, good quality and reasonably priced. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel, although room was small. Ok for a single person, could be cramped for a couple. There were larger rooms available. Great staff, very friendly and helpful, good pool and gym, range of food is extensive in the buffets, breakfast has everything you want and more. Nearby mall is good also with good food options and supermarket.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for one night and was not impressed with the hotel.tired old rooms smoky hallways and lifts even though I requested a non smoking room the smell was in the hallways and lifts.The main restaurant on the ground floor was ok but had limited vegetarian food and when I asked the chef to boil some noodles in salty water instead of chicken broth, they said sorry we can't. So I went across to the Kempeski hotel and they were more than happy to offer bespoke noodles with vegetables of my choice. I would not stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My experience was pathetic....i was coming back from the mall and was entering the hotel pullman when the security guard hit the barrier on my head and i was suffering from severe pain all night and there was bump on my head after frw hours of the incident and when i reported the hotel manager Mr Dodi he was least concerned and on top of that he didnt even offered to take me to the doctor or something i will not suggest this hotel and will not stay here again....pathetic customer service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband and I stayed in Grand Deluxe King room at the new tower. The room was clean and the design is modern and has a warm, cozy ambience. The freestanding tub is big and is strategically placed so that one can watch the tv outside and listen to the accompanying stereo installed in the bathrooms while taking a bath.The highlight of my stay was the breakfast buffet. The variety is ample. They have four types of cuisine - Indonesian, Western, Chinese and Japanese. I personally love the variety provided for the Indonesian section. They actually served 3 types of Indonesian-style rice for just one of the breakfasts - nasi merah, nasi kuning and nasi uduk. There were also some traditional kueh and jamu drinks. The buffet venue was so big that they provided a map to show the locations of the different stations. The food was delicious too (love the berliner!!!).Service provided was excellent. All the staff, including the security, that we passed by greeted us with a warm smile making us feel welcome. We would also like to thank Ricky at the reception for acceding to our requests and being gracious when providing us his service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Always a pleasure to be back at this property. Great location good food and friendly service. The staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable. The only suggestion I have is to get the carpet dry cleaned/changed in the older rooms. the atmosphere needs some freshness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Comfortable stay at the hotel. Booked the executive rooms and layout, cleanliness and comfort are well taken care of. No room issues at all. Minor feedback on Executive Club Lounge. There were no staff at the reception when I came in. Staff were busy setting up the tables for evening cocktails and was surprised at my presence. Asked for my room number and body language showed signs of not convinced that I am an executive lounge guests. (They got suspicious and probably thought I was a random guest) Got my name wrong upon confirmation of my room number and manage to rectify that afterwards. I decided not to be offended as the staff were just doing their job but they may need improvement on body language and first impressions to executive club guests. They made a good recovery afterwards so all is fine.Special thanks to Mr Arvi from executive lounge who went that extra mile to make my breakfast experience a memorable one. He paid attention to details and ensure that everything is sufficient while I indulged in the breakfast. I also made a request for a specific dish and was attended to properly as well. This is the kind of executive lounge experience that should be inculcated.On a side note, I was rather disappointed that I was not entitled to breakfast buffet at the Sana Sini restaurant. My previous stay in Pullman Central Park at the Executive room, I was invited to enjoy a wider spread of buffet section at the hotel restaurant and not just from the club lounge. I thought this policy applies to Pullman Jakarta as well but turns out, that I was not covered for breakfast. Perhaps, the hotel should look into consistency of policy and guest entitlement since it is under the same brand. That was a minor disappointment but thankfully, the experience in the executive lounge makes up for it. I will sure to come back again but I hope this time, the consistency can be improved for a better and functional experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cozy circumstances.... the room small but comfortable.... the bathroom is good..... complete and delicious breakfast.... very warm service from all the hotel staff.... very pleasent with the wifi and tv channel....
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are having dinner to celebrate our daughter birthday at sana sini restaurant. Best restaurant yet so far. Been trying some buffet hotel restaurant but this one is fit my qualification so much! They serve fresh food good taste and excellent service since they give us small treat celebration for surprising my daughter. They are very welcome and quite big also because they had several type cuisine from local, asia japanese, western. Overall we will decided to go back here again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome property, Luxury at its bestLives upto Pullman brandAt the central districtNear a posh mall, Good shopping area in mallNice foodGood business centerI didnt stay in this place since I was at central park pullman but used to come daily to have meetings with colleague who was in this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second time I've stayed in an Accor hotel in Indonesia. Pullman Jakarta is one of the great hotels under this management. Their staff once again provide first class service. Brekkie room was fantastic and the hotel is centrally located, in walking distance to the shopping mall. I highly recommend the french bistro called Cork and Screw which is in the front mall. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!!!! NB, you can't wear things or flip flops. Luckilyu for me, concierge warned me before I went there :) .. lol. Make sure you don't Don't get confused with the other Pullman as they are both near the shopping malls, the one at the CBD is definetely better and closer to the airport.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Superb hotel- centrally located near very good shopping mall. Views of the city over the nearby footbridge are superb at night. Jakarta is a massively crowded,frantic city, and this hotel is a place of calm and luxury in the middle of it. The staff are very helpful, and will order taxis for you, arrange airport transfers etc . If you are sightseeing,try the old quarter- pretty buzzing and lots to watch, and go to Monas, but maybe skip the 'harbour'! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone looking for a touch of luxury, peace and quiet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman has a great service and is located in the hearth of Jakarta. We can see the Bundaran HI from our room through the window. The design of the hotel is full of contemporary art. The room size is huge. The breakfast was amazing with abundant varieties of Japanese Food, Chinese Food, Western Food as well as Local Food.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We really enjoyed staying at pullman jakarta thamrin. The staff were very helpfull, kind and warm. The food and the atmosphere were really great. Special thank to staff at the executive lounge who treat my family so well, our daughter still remember one of them, ms. Wulan :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First things first, the room is outstanding and the housekeeping done by Dian were excellent. Very precise and good. Took care of the finer detail of everything. She is well trained and execute her task professionally.In the lobby area is the Back door bar and this is also a pleasant place to spend free time. Both cater for smoking and non smoking. Very good service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A great place in the heart of jakarta, walking distance from great malls. Best service and perfect hospitalityThe view is perfect. Their breakfast is inclusive with many sections of different cuisines that cater a lot of tastes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is my first time staying in Pullman Tharmin. Location and hospitality is great. Staffs are very helpful and it is highly recommended. Wide spread of breakfast to choose from and will definitely come back again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Central location opposite Plaza Indonesia. Great service all around. Rooms are ok - clean and functional. Nice amenities, but no toothbrush, so bring your own. Swimming pool is simple, but cooling despite hot day, Nice deck chairs to lounge around. Massage was fantastic.Free wifi without password is convenient, and good enough for email/youtube, but not for streaming movies.The best part of this hotel is the breakfast spread - very extensive spread with good quality. There is a healthy section with quinoa smoothies, chia seed smoothies and gluten free items; international section, chinese section; japanese section; local section with wide variety of unique items from different parts of Indonesia. The eggs section was unique - there was a tray with eggs boiled to diff timings 3/7/10mins, and the daily eggs done different ways which changed daily - I saw baked ala spanish way, egg with bak kwa... interesting. I stayed for 3 days and didn't have to repeat anything from the buffet. Awesome.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the service was good and fastnot all the amenities were provided in the room, but when we contact housekeeping, they responded fastthe room was kinda small actuallythe meal was goodi also did the meeting room reservation for my company but the marketing was stiff.recommended for stay but i will think twice to hold company meeting in here
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel gets a 5 star rating on all aspects from me. If you have time in between meetings and you don't want to sit in your room, the Connectivity Lounge is a perfect spot to sit and kill some emails. The facilities available and the service are of outstanding quality. I would like to make a special mention of Rio for exceptional service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Big hotel, very nice breakfast and dinner buffet. Room, Service, was great and absolutely positive experience! Breakfast and dinner buffet has a huge selection of cuisine types.The hotel is located in Tamrin area the wall street of Jakarta. Just a walking distance from the biggest shopping centre of Jakarta. Grand Indonesia
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed for two nights and the room was very nice and clean, the breakfast was also satisfying. The atmosphere was nice and the employees were very helpfulWill recommend this hotel to my colleagues and relatives 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

this is the first time me and my family stay at pullman jakarta indonesia, really memorable stay, we got upgrade to the grand deluxe executive wich is free access to the executive lounge. especially mentioned to executive lounge team, wulan, tika, suci, arvi and nathan. Really appreciated and happy to return and stay to pullman jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time over night at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, it was great, the room was really clean, the bed was comfortable, and really cozy to sleep.. The staff are really helpful and friendly.. Thank you Pullman
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this Pullman Jakarta Indonesia and the staycation experience was amazing! The staff were very friendly and helpful since my first step at the hotel, I didn’t have to wait more than 10 minutes to get my room opened (as if they were ready for my arrival) and during my stay.It was a wonderful stay because the facilities were meticulous and every service went very smooth for us. The room that we stayed in was huge and the view was the beautiful cityscape of Jakarta. Both in the morning and at night, the view was always terrific from the room they gave us. They also have this very unique pillow menu for me to choose and somehow I loved it! Pullman Jakarta Indonesia has really made my stay like-no-other with this options, our sleep was really nice and sound. Surely will recommend this hotel to my colleagues and my relatives who will visit Indonesia next month!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's centrally-located and a walking distance to malls. The room booked for me was too small but the sheets and pillows are lovely and cozy. Room service is quick and efficient. Food is delicious but on the pricey side (slightly above hotel room's service range). Buffet breakfast is expansive. Internet is free and sufficient. I don't mind staying here again but will most likely book a bigger room. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I must say that every time I check in and spend time at the executive lounge at the 2nd floor, the service and attention I get is superior,professional and very sincere. I especially like to commend Wulan, who is very attentive and professional in her duties. Kudos to Pullman Thamrin for having such staff. Well done. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

every night i got new snacks in my room, from chocolate to traditional snacks with stories of it, the bed was heaven, location is great, breakfast were superb, coffee was excellent. staffs were also very helpful
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been staying at Pullman hotel for the past 2-3 years for my business trip and I will keep on coming here. The hotel is located at the best location in the city, walking distance to the shooing mall and just a short drive to the business area. They also have a really great selection for buffet (breakfast, lunch and dinner). I would really recommend pullman if you are looking for a nice hotel around the "bunderan hi" areaI always enjoyed my stay at Pullman hotel. Thanks to all the staff that is always helpful and friendly.I would like to thank Zemmy who has help me many many times during my stay at Pullman since a few years ago and Ageng, the front desk manager who is very hospitable.Thank you Pullman, see you soon.Denis S
-------------------------------------------------------------------

An amazing surprise.To realize that an indonesian hotel could have a service so good in every sense.The facilities, gym, restaurants, location, rooms, Everything was perfect.Even the breakfast, with spanish music
-------------------------------------------------------------------

it's such a good day and a mood booster for me when I entered the hotel and greeted friendly by Mitha as the welcomer there. she's so nice with the sweet smile, not only to me but to all of the people who walk in front of her. she makes me like I wanna come again next time. thank you Pullman Thamrin Jakarta Indonesia! and thank you, Mitha! you're awesome.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

located in the heart of Jakarta city overlooking busy Jakarta's traffic with its well-known Bundaran HI, our stay in Pullman was surely exceptional.Was stay here for 2 nights with the family for my in-law birthday and we got big-comfortable and spacious room.we love the bathroom! Had breakfast in Sana Sini restaurant and it was amazingly great, it has a wide variety of tasty food with live cooking show, service staff was very friendly to my little baby and we were given a nice spot for breakfast with a view. Swimming pool is big enough, changing room is clean. we were satisfied and surely will come back very soon
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin is a very nice hotel with fabulous service. We stayed 4 fantastic and memorable nights in this hotel and enjoyed our stay very much. Very friendly staff, especially mr Nova who was very helpful. He did all his efforts to ensure that we had a pleasant stay. Many thanks to mr Nova. The hotel is very well situated in a good location, just across the street from 2 big luxurious shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia Mall and Grand Indonesia Mall). There is a overhead bridge for pedestrians to cross the street. The rooms are modern, beautiful, clean and have comfortable beds and a nice bathtub. The buffet Breakfast was amazing. The best! 4 food stations with Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese and Western foods. We tried food from all stations and must say that the food was very good and delicious. In every aspect very amazing hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located in CBD area. Easy to get food from the 2 shopping mail opposite the hotel. The room is clean and internet is fast. Breakfast is the highlight as there are some many good dishes that you are not sure which one to start with.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the hotel is located near two shopping malls across the street which is walking distance. comfy room and great customer service. the bed is so comfy that we skipped breakfast. there's bath tub as well. all the staffs are very friendly as well
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located in the city central, just 5minuts walk u find 2big malls across the street. I was stay here for 3D2N with my friends at grand deluxe room.The room is spacious and very comfortable with pool view, and I fell in love with the bathtub. Love it!Breakfast was amazing, all food very tasty, many selection of food with live cooking show. I will come back with my family soon.Thumbs up for Pullman .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin has a very nice location, it is right in the center of Jakarta CBD. Just walking distance to 2 Luxury Shopping Mall. The staff are very nice and friendly, especially Mr. Erick, the Duty Manager who helps a lot during my stay. However, there is one deficiency in this hotel that, although it is under Accor Management, this hotel does not honor Accor Advantage Plus Membership. So, for Accor Plus Member, you can not expect to enjoy any benefit Accor Plus Membership offer in this hotel, which for me is a minus in selecting hotel as I am a Platinum Accor Membership
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One week before the trip, we decided to stay at Pullman Jakarta. The in charge person, Ms Merry had well arrange our stay in Jakarta during such a short time. The meeting room and the services provided is professional and efficiency. The hotel provided excellent breakfast, from western to the local delight, you may find one suit for your stomach. We had been passed 3 wonderful nights with Pullman Jakarta. Great thanks to Merry team for such perfect arrangement. Good location, good food, good service, Pullman Jakarta will definitely be our first choice in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was here last month for weekend stay. Got upgraded to a bigger room, thank you so much! Love everything about our stay esp the breakfast buffet! It is truly the best i've had in Jkt so far. Not only they have extra variety of almost everything, but it was tasty and staff were friendly even in busy situation. Concierge haris and resto staff venny were very helpful. Also thanks to one of resto staff with suit (maybe he was the restaurant manager) who was very helpful as well. Generally, everyone I met was so kind. Would love to come back! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am impressed with staff in this hotel. Especially worth mentioning Rusli, he was very attentive at the restaurant and made sure to provide requested items at dinner. I recommend this place. I will return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spend 2 nights at this hotel during my last visit. The location is very central and few steps away from Plaza Indonesia and other Shopping mall where you can find nice food and coffeeshop. However, the room is pretty small but overall is comfortable. Service is good only small hiccup when I make 1 hour advance booking for Silverbird taxi but it took another 15 mins to wait as the booking hasn't been placed or shared from Reception to the Doorman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At first, i choose this hotel because of the famous breakfast buffet. But I really love good quality bed and pillow more. I will come back to stay here again for sure.We can walk to the largest shopping mall, Grand Indonesia within 300 metres and the luxurious shoppingmall, Plaza indonesia just across the street. The staff is very friendly and fast check-in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my third time at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia and I have to say that I am still very impressed at how well this hotel is. Service, Room, Quality of food. Every aspect still amazing and highly recommended. This time I had the chance to really utilize the lounge with meetings and just light meals and have to say I was happy and impressed with the service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location, near business district.Comfy room. Restaurant very delicious.Staff very kind and helpful...Definitely will go here again!I would like to say thank you to Pak Arvi, Pak Filipus, and Bu Wulan for your help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A superb hotel very central to the SCBD in Jakarta, terrific value, super rooms, service was outstanding, the buffet and breakfast are one of the best I have ever encountered in all my travels, so many cooking stations and cuisines, all fresh food and truly a feast!Delicious Malbec wine, good value and a very knowledgeable Sommelier called RUSLI who showed me the vast numbers of wine they had available and a credit to the hotel.I look forward to my next business trip to Jakarta and stay at this super hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just spent one week in this hotel as usual when I come in Indonesia, I confirm that staff is perfect and that Pullman is a first international class hotel with an incredible customers service and Sana Sini restaurant with an amazing buffet. I recommend it very strongly ! here is my ranking of best Pullman's best guest officers :- Lia, guest relations : just perfect, smart and efficient ;- Rusly, fine wines advisor who will be able to make you taste a world selection of excellent wines ;-Dwi, who makes a very good job at Sana Sini restaurant.Enjoy Pullman Thamrin's services !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a regular guest of Pullman Thamrin Jakarta, where i always fell at ease.Excellent location in the heart off the busy and fascinating Jakarta. Great buffet and superb service. The staff is great, excellent and well trained, and this time a good note to house keeping, and the friendly Miss Dian.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

spent a outstanding weekend in Pullman Jakarta. was an excellent choice. Rooms fantastic, service outstanding, location for car free day was unbeatable - leisure, pleasure, enjoy. Upon my arrival The welcomer Sari was greet me and fam with her big smile continue check-in with Sofyan went very smooth and friendly. I was guided into elevator and room by bellman ibnu. The breakfast buffet at sana sini was breathtaking. My favorite the freshly baked waffles. even the chef natalie came to my desk and greet us AMAZING. Jacuzzi and gym was comfort and relaxing, Thanks guys for all your efforts to ensure me and family having memorable experiences
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is easily one of the best hotel in Jakarta. Our room is big and very comfortable. The bed is very comfy. The breakfast buffet is great with wide spread selections. Great location in central Jakarta, close by to the malls.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying here for 3D2N for the weekend with my wife. A short getaway to escape from routine chores at home. Staying at in-town-hotel. The hotel location is in the heart of the Jakarta city. Plaza Indonesia (PI), known as one of the best shopping centers in town, is just across the street.Staffs are very attentively welcome, friendly and yet still show their professionalism. Check in process was fast and efficient. We were staying at grand deluxe room at 5th floor, facing to the street. Right in front of PI. Although at night the MRT project produced little noise, it was still tolerable. The room was spacious with beautiful bathroom and walk in closet. Breakfast was also nice as they served complete menu divided into four sections, like Japanese, Western, Chinese and Indonesian. Taste was good as well. With this chance I'd like to deliver my gratitude to all the friendly staffs assisting us during the stay. Special thanks to the gentleman, Sofyan at front desk, for his warmth and professionalism. He assisted us during our stay here for the whole 3days, made us feel like home and made this short getaway memorable. Hopefully we'll be return in another chance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am here for my second timeMy first visit was awesome and me and my husband were so pleased about the hotel's serviceBut this second time begin with a bit of dissapointmentI clearly confirmed the hotel that i am going to arrive and the hotel will be ready at 2 pm todayBut here iam, on 3.12 pm, and my room isnt ready yetWe spesifically choose Pullman Thamrin because of the memories given last visitPlease maintain the good service Pullman
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Went there for dinner at Sana Sini restaurant with my friends. Buffet dinner had great selections, with good quality of food. I was happy with the ribeye, but too bad there were only prawn, and some choice of clams on seafood section. We enjoyed most of them, apart from the pasta. Need to spare at least couple of hours to enjoy the buffet because of the huge layout. As mentioned in the name "Sana Sini" means we have to go here and there back and forth to enjoy each section. Very recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time staying in Pullman Thamrin Area after being to the city so many times. I was pleasantly surprised. All the staff were very friendly and check-in was a breeze. I was assist by Mr (Forgot The Name) and he was very efficient. He was friendly and at the same time not too overbearing. I was upgraded and the room was huge! Room was very neat and clean. Pool is very nice with jaccuzzi pool by the side. I'll come againThank You Pulman Thamrin
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First impression is nice hotel with large lobby area. Staff throughout the hotel were amazing and go above and beyond to ensure my experience is a memorable one. Thank for Dwi at restaurant and Raka at Front desk for great service. Highly recommended
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I reserve the table to the booking section for my birthday dinner for June 30th. The next morning I make sure we're going to have dinner through my WA message. The night I came with my partner. I was very surprise was immediately greeted warmly and called my name and escorted by the reception delivered to the table that I have ordered. The table that I ordered the place is very nice and more private with an elegant sofa. And came the restaurant manager with warm welcome and wish me happy birthday and give birthday cake surprise even small We really like the many food choices available. I like the station of Indonesian food. Despite many other food choices. Seems one pieces is missing,Just then there is no entertaiment like acoustics or other. The Candle light not on (electric)However, the service is excellent and we are really well looked after by offering available buffet food. Next time I will bring our family to dinner here.Give credit 5star services for reservation, receptionist, chefs in station also the good manager (I forget their name).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent service and very welcome staff start from drop my luggage, security check, greeters personnel, staff receptions and porter to room. The receptionist offer me an upgrade to new wing building face to MH.Thamrin with 49sq m2 room with some reasonable extra. I feel worth it to pay it since i got almost double size, quite new building and can see the view to MH.Thamrin and Bunderan Hotel Indonesia. The staff also offered me a baby cot for my 2nd child 1 month old. They also give a nice fruit platters and i very like it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My company regularly uses the Pullman for visiting staff and property exhibitions.When I checked in I asked the receptionist if she had details of our company on the system and she said no record which was a bit strange considering we had just spent over $15,000 there 2 weeks earlier.Checked in and given a tiny room on the 9th floor. Otherwise food and gym and pool good.For the money there are better places to stay and I will be moving on our corporate business.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, it's such great experience to stay here at Pullman... because it's Lebaran holiday and the traffic in central Jakarta is so freaking friendly, so I can really feel "enjoy Jakarta" moment with my family especially my daughter who really excited with public transportation... while I was stayed here, the room is so comfortable, clean and the view from my room is good.. no problem with the air conditioner, I really love the bathroom because They have bathtub and shower also... I also tried the room service here, the taste is delicious.. I ordered for fish and chips for lunch and for dinner nasi goreng and sate campur.. those foods are delicious! My favorite is fish and chips 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located In the heart of jakarta. Spacious living room with comfortable bedroom & fantastic bathroom. nice view from my bed. Love the pool so much, as well as the gym and whirlpool. Thanks a lot for the hospitality and room upgrade.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like Pullman Jakarta Thamrin as a 5 star hotel with great Sana Sini restaurant, convenient and spacious lobby and very welcome staffs.I really enjoyed the variaty of breakfast buffets in Sana Sini restaurant and also the staffs were very pleasant. The room was clean and comfort. You can enjoy a lot ofTV channels of your choices. I certainly recommend this hotel to my friends!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After so many years in Indonesia, I finally tried out the Pullman for brunch. It always comes highly recommended, but for some reason I can't help sticking to the traditional top places. I must say, this is not a place you should ignore. Its got it all!!! My only complaint is that if its your first time, they should give you a map so you can find the food stations. They have tonnes of great food, but I missed some of the food stations, not knowing they were there. Only when I went to look for deserts did I see some of the other fantastic mouth watering spots that I wished I knew were there before I stuffed myself. You must try this place out - definitely one of the best Brunch spots in Jakarta.... But be prepared, they only open at 12pm and they guard that time like the SS police. Other places are more casual about timing and allow you in from around 11am.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best pullman i ever stay... been stay in pullman in other city/country but for me this is one of the best pullman in term of service and facilities. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The service was complited i enjoy the jacuzzi at locker area i can relax. Breakfast was amazing with a lot of choices. The location right in city center. Eventhough the hotel was old but i cant feel it because they already upgraded. The only minus thing i cant use my accor plus card and room was small. Overall it was an excellent stay. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Again and again i visited this Hotel !! So friendly all of the employees !! So much fun with the facilites like gym pool jacuzzi sauna !! With comfortable bedroom so love it !! Thanks Pullman Jakarta Indonesia !! Love you !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room is very specious and comfortable. All the staff is very polite and friendly. I would like to thanks special the staff in VIP Lounge, Tika, Arvi, Angle, Shelby, and Amir. They were so helpful and professional. I will coming back to this hotel if possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in their Grand Deluxe Executive Suite. Woohoo. Love the pool view from my bedroom. Spacious living room with comfortable bedroom and fantastic bathroom. I also love their hospitality. Fast response for everything. Definitely a keeper. Psst, their breakfast was also amazing!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect place in town for the weekend stay.. nice room, excellent taste of the Sana Sini restaurant. Shopping mall surround easy to reach . Simply best Hotel for family weekend to enjoy and explore more.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's more than a decades I never had a chance to bring my family, esp. my mom, to stay in 5 stars hotel, since she just love to take care house hold like most of ancient woman, and stay home.To change the atmosphere, I decided to brought my parents to see the sparkle glitter day night life in the heart of Jakarta, stayed for 2 nights in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, and celebrate my mom's birthday.Once we arrived at the lobby was almost 9 PM after had a traffic a long the way. Quite exhausted, and my baby girl was sleeping in my mom's arm.The security guard here, I guess, is the most cordial security staff I ever know. Well, in the front desk, Kevin, helps checked me in, less than 5 minutes I got our rooms on 10th floor. He asked me as well if need a hand to bring our belongings to our rooms. He just such a nice man.On the 2nd night we had supper in Grand Indonesia to celebrate my mom's birthday. Surprisingly, when we came back and open our door, voila! A simple sweet chocolate cake staring to us, saying "happy birthday", and I know it's dedicated to her.Thank you Pullman team! To let us have a memorable and exquisite stay in the heart Jakarta. Esp. Akmal to make it happened.Pullman is located in strategic and prime area which close to the office building, entertainment places, and culinary. Well, the traffic front of hotel caused by mass construction on the Sudirman st. by government which out of our hand, but didn't make any less wonderful experience stay with Pullman.Tips for you: choose top floor facing to main street.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The change in name of the property from Hotel Nikko to the Pullman Hotel has not affected the quality of service for this hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly bellman as well as the receptionist in front during check-in. Although the hotel is a bit on the "old" side, the rooms are quite clean and the bed very comfortable. Tthe bathrooms however could use some update due to the wear & tear. The breakfast was excellent with a WIDE range of selections, from Western to Indonesian to Chinese. It would probably take you two days to try every single item! The gym is quite sufficient for a good workout. The hotel is very good value for price & the location is great. Definitely would stay here again for business!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

staying at your grand deluxe room last week was unforgettable with its spacious and beautiful Jakarta with city view at night , everything seems very smooth from check in to check out . breakfast also amazing variety. the staff are very friendly and particular mention to your staff Filipus who consistently serve an excellence service with his warm smile and attentive question who always try to make sure I have a nice stay and He help me to arrange My husband surprise birthday at our rooms. he help me organize from flower, Ballon and the decoration . would recommend this hotel to all my colleagues . Thank you
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 2 nights at the deluxe room which is spacious, very comfortable with living room and a view to the city. It's a very recommended place to stay in Jakarta both for business and leisure. If you wish to shop, some of the best shopping centers are just across the street. The service is excellent. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying here with my wife for a short getaway and not regretting everything we experienced. Thank you for smooth checkin and great breakfast at Sana Sini. We enjoyed the healthy choices available such as the granola muesli and fruits.The Deluxe room is spacious and spotlessly clean. Unfortunately my card doesnt work several times and i hope the hotel fix this. Service is smiley and friendly at the reception and restaurant. Pak Doddy and Sari are kind and been assisting us with some help. Thank you everyone. We'll be back! Everything is awesome.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was checking in at night handle by Tiara (if i'm not wrong). Got access to Executive Lounge, Thanks to Mr.Teuku (Asst.FOM). I love the pool, me with my friend was enjoying it after had evening cocktail at executive lounge, was handle by Suci with nicely & politely. The next morning, did not have much time to tasted the buffet breakfast, they do have lot of choices. Will be my first choice for business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is our annual routine to have a short getaway on our Wedding Anniversary to give ourselves a good quality time. We take this moment as an important day and that's why months before the anniversary, we take time to plan what are we going to do. And this year we decided to have a staycation at @pullman.jkt.indo Thamrin CBD and boy what an awesome experience we had!We loved the hospitality and the services, especially when you are greeted personally by their GM (trust me, you'll feel like one of those VIP's in town hehe). The room we're staying was beautiful, nice and super cozy (our kids enjoyed it so much!). We enjoyed our wine and cocktail on The Executive Lounge before we had our anniversary dinner in one of Jakarta's finest restaurant @sanasinipullman and yes we left with a full-yet-satisfied belly. The breakfast was also superb! Me and my wife agreed that this is one of our most enjoyable Staycation by far and we are more than happy to recommend Pullman to our families and friends. Looking forward to have another wonderful experience like this next year! Thank you @pullmanhotels :))
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying here for a night. The staff at the reception was polite and welcome. The Middle East decoration at the lobby also looked very nice. I found the room was spacious, bright and clean with modern style. The big square soft pillow made me sleep like a baby.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My business partner booked platinum business.she ended in regular room as you make this a bureaucratic silly happening for guests. You do not look at opportunity and status if guests with Accor! Very sorry to experience this!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying here for 1 night on weekend, we had an excellent night.. we enjoyed the spread of excellent breakfast in their restaurant called sana sini, room is excellent and room service is ready to serve us within 30 minutes, we had great dinner. More offer staff are very welcome and care, we remember Pak Salim in sana sini who took care of us during lunch and breakfast with heartfully service.I would recommend all my friend and come back soon when we visit jakarta again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was spending 2 nights in Pullman Thamrin, the first impression when entering the hotel hall was well decorated and great friendly staffs (even the security guards are friendly). check-in process are seamless, and the room is well maintained, the hotel is located in the city central, food & shopping can be easily accessible.Breakfast selection are great, and you will be spoiled by the choices available, i have a chance to check out the gym facilities at the night for a night gym, well-equipped gym room is great when you do not want to travel out due to the Jakarta traffics.Overall, a very pleasant experience with Pullman, it live the brand name and all the expectation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for our wedding in Jakarta. We loved the centralized location and the cleanliness. Plus the breakfast was amazing! There were different sections such as Indonesian, Western, and even sushi! I stayed here a few years ago as well and don't have any complaints. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a centrally located hotel near many shopping centres- walking distance to a Starbucks - great breakfast bar so menu choices- each country has a different selection- we were looking for porridge they overheard us and made some to order 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Long overdue review of Pullman Thamrin.Location is great, there's a high end shopping mall opposite and I love the Cigar bar. Had stayed in another hotel in another area before but still prefer Pullman, probably because of the cigar bar at the lobby. Overall the hotel is great! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The lobby of Pullman Jakarta Indonesia was very modern and bright. Certainly had the signature of a hotel that Tyler Brule would approve.I was promptly checked into one of the smaller rooms with a queen-sized bed. I soon realised I was put in the old wing, which to be honest, is not all bad. The room is icy smaller than what I'm normally used to and the colours made it claustrophobic. The bathroom only had a tub with no separate shower stall. It didn't come with a toothbrush or shaving kit. Good thing I have one set from the another hotel stay. The toilet was wedged in-between the basin and the tub. Not impressed. After the first night, I decided to ask from an upgrade. Ricky at front-desk was very friendly and accommodating. He gave me a tour of the available room types. I finally settled on the Grand Deluxe Room, which was about 40+ sqm. I have to reiterate that Ricky's service was exemplary. The king bed was plush. Separate stalls for shower and toilet, with a full length tub.Another thing I have to rave about is the breakfast buffet spread! The food choices far surpassed any hotel I've stayed in so far. Quality was also top-notch. Too bad I had to rush off to office every morning; the Jakarta morning traffic is truly legendary.Mega malls are within walking distance for those who like to shop. Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia are enough to keep you occupied for hours on end. Anything you need, you can find it there.Overall, the 3-night stay was pleasant. I would probably advise to request for rooms in the new wing if it's available. Also, if you're doing laundry and like to have your shirts starched, do make sure you indicate to have them lightly starched (there isn't such an option; just write it down maybe). My two shirts came back so starched that I didn't need hangers. Was a little worried they were damaged from the high-heat pressing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great business hotel located within the CBD area with 2 big malls located within a mere 5mins walk. Breakfast spread was scrumptious! Room was fabby with great housekeeping. Pool was great too! In summary, this should be the hotel should you have to visit the CBD area. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was my first time staying at Pullman Jakarta and I cant wait to come back! From the moment I arrived at the hotel, all the staffs were friendly. The receptions bani, suci and ricky assisted me with Checked in process and it was fast and smooth. I really recommend you to try the talk of the town, which is their Sana Sini Restaurant. I had my breakfast there and before I even got to the entrance, Nabilla approach me warmly and all the staff like salim and fiqri were extremely helpfull. Staying on the weekend, I recommend you to try the local event Car Free Day just outside of the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice modern hotel with all the facilities you would expect from a 5 star city hotel. The breakfast selection is stand out, something for all tastes along with decent coffee. Hotel is located in the central business district but still allow plenty of time to get about in Jakarta traffic. Staff were attentive and friendly. Happy to recommend.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great place to relax during weekend. The security team in front of the lobby was very warm, greet me with smile and I was guided with the welcomer which is nice. the most crucial thing, the checked in process was extremely satisfying, I still remebered the name of staff Sofyan, he handed me the key and the deposit receipt by go out from his counter and standing in front of me. For me, this is such a warm welcome and he did a positive hospitality. The breakfast was extremely satisfying as we'll with a few waiters paying attention, the waiters Mr. Salim was very helpfull. Really 5 star service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Consistent and reliable service at all levels.Felt like given surprise birthday gift when given an upgrade room Again give another hotel to follow Pullman Jakarta top service and quality.Wish I can purchase to be enjoyed in my room the best frozen yoghurt offered during breakfast
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room deco is modern & contemporary. I love the location because it is right in the middle of shopping galore. Love the spread of breakfast buffet, from local to western and Japanese menu. The service staff was superb. I purposely left magazines & brochures (which i do not need) but the staff emailed me asking whether I forget and offered to be mailed back to me (to Kuala Lumpur). This is Customer Service!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was the first time at Pullmann hotel in jakarta, I will never forget it.Everything is done so you are well, I am really impressed by thefriendliness of the staff.At breakfast I got a small language course in bahasa language,even during the smoking break you get the nicest conversations.I will definitely return to Pullmann.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This will be my first stay at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin and being overwhelmed by the charm and hospitality of the staff. I did requested for a non smoking room, higher floor and away from the elevator. To my surprise, there really give me what I had requested. I have no complain about the room. Room is spacious and everything on my stay was fantastic at this hotel, including food for both restaurant and room service. The outdoor pool is very nice and the two large shopping malls being just across the road are very handy for dining option and shopping. Oh yeah, they have large range of cable TV channels. Coming back? Absolutely. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazing hotel, the service is inexplicable. You have attention all the time, and the honey moon surprise wal really cute!!Bealtiful room with everything a couple need.Great pool and spa. Good localization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine staying in the same hotel where VIP delegates from around the world are staying for their forum. Despite the high profile week, including the Indonesian president visiting, the hotel was able to manage the special occasion well. This should give you a clear indication of the level of service you can expect at this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent welcome and quality of the bedrooms.Dian is a great professionnal to Clean and also very sympathic to welcome you !I recommend this fantastic hôtelReal download town hotelGood foodNice wiew
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been a while since I last visited Pullman Hotel in Thamrin but to my great but pleasant surprise most of the staff from the front office to the restaurant still remember me and addressed me by name.I must say the rooms have also been nicely and tastefully upgraded. And as a Gold member of the Accor group, I was upgraded to a very nicely refurbished room with great pillow selection and a comfortable bed.I had also chosen this hotel for its central location and being someone who travels regularly, I had to travel on my birthday. To my surprise, after a tiring day to walk into my room filled with goodies and a personalise cake with a special birthday wish from the hotel, truly make my stay memorable.I would like to say thank you for the warm hospitality and for making me feel very welcome.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really recommend this hotel for business trip. There service is really good. I went down to buy a lighter to smoke and I met hotel manager. He asked me what I want, and told me there is no lighter in the store. Right after that he went to some where and gave me a lighter. I was so impressed for his service mind. And maybe because of his service mind, every other staffs are very kind and nice as well. I really recommend this hotel for business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic and magnificent breakfast at sana-sini restaurant. Friendly staff and skilful. Room’s cleanliness is superb and spotless. We also try room service and the food delivery on time and proper presentation…. Good location and very near to shopping mall just a cross the street. Thank you Pullman Jakarta for warm hospitality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you Pullman Jakarta for the amazing stay. It was my first solo trip so I was quite nervous, but I truly felt at home. I loved the great hospitality, every staff greets you and is readily available to help you around the place. The room was smaller than some hotels but for one person it was more than sufficient. Service was excellent and the food at Sana Sini is truly unforgettable. They have a variety of food selections (buffet and ala carte) and everything tastes so good. I would highly recommend visitors to try the longan iced tea which happened to be my favorite drink while there, the daily buffet breakfast and Sunday brunch. I am missing the Nutella pancakes already! The hotel is also located in the center of town, with two large shoppings malls within walking distance via the pedestrian bridge (roughly about 5-7 minutes to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia). I would highly recommend this hotel for a lovely stay in Jakarta and I'll definitely be back again in the near future. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The breakfast is amazing at this Pullman hotel, I rate it higher than the Intercontinental in Jakarta. The staff are very friendly, helpful and they make you feel like they know you.Some rooms are small due to the Pullman in a prievious life being a Japanese owned hotel, but for a business trip they are fine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was stay in this hotel only 1 night but its a remarkable stay experience. While you are not doubt of a very good location where the hotel was just in the corner of Bundaran HI. Walk away only to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. I take the dinner in the Hotel which its a good decision since the food at Sana Sini Restaurant was plenty of choice with the good taste that I usually not find on others hotel coffee shop. The staff was also great like Pak Hari he is have good smile and attention to the guestThe bed room was cozy and practical with the view of Thamrin street since I am stay on Saturday then on Monday morning its a fun to see the area was full with people on Car Free Day. You also can choose what kind of pillow that you preferred, Its a really 5 star serviceI am surely will come back again and stay with this hotel, I see they have a plenty options to explore after their hotel been renovated. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I only stayed one night, but everything was fine. A very warm and efficient welcome. Excellent breakfast buffet the next morning, and friendly staff all around. The hotel has competitive pricing, especially compared to all the hotels that are literally "neighbours" which is a big plus. The only thing to remark is that the standard rooms are a tad small - but they're clean, have comfortable beds and all the amenities you need are there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I hadn't stayed at a Pullman property before visiting Jakarta on business. I stayed at the Thamrin CBD location at the Bundaran Hotel Indonesia roundabout (where the Selamat Datang statue is located.) It's conveniently located across the street from the Plaza Indonesia mall, which has numerous dining options. You reach the mall easily via a covered elevated walkway over the road.We arrived from DC via Tokyo at the hotel at 1 a.m. on a Sunday morning. I'd arranged with the concierge for a Blue Bird taxi pickup at the airport, which made our arrival (at midnight after traveling for 28 hours) smooth and trouble-free. Check-in was fast and the service (as it was during my entire stay) was excellent. The bed in the room was very comfortable and I slept well both nights. The gym is fairly well-equipped and the adjoining pool is very nice. I spent Sunday afternoon in the business center, which has two large desks and large Mac desktop computers. Plenty of space on which to spread out my work and very quiet. The adjoining executive lounge is by membership only, though I believe that hotel guests can use it for a fee. We met there with our business group the following morning.The staff in the hotel was uniformly attentive and friendly. The breakfast spread is the among the best I've seen anywhere in the world. Multiple islands serving everything from English breakfast and custom-made omelets to sushi, Chinese specialties, and desserts. All for approximately US$25. I didn't need lunch either day.The room I had wasn't particularly spacious but had a comfortable sectional sofa along the back wall. Plenty of high-quality wooden hangers, an iron and board, and safe in the closet. The bathroom counter space is a bit limited but the shower has a window that opens onto the room so it's bright and feels spacious. The free wi-fi was sufficient but not especially swift. I was able to do what I needed online, however, without a headache.I'm very impressed with the Pullman hotel chain based on this single location and will certainly try another hotel in a different city if I have the chance. To the management and staff: well done. You've created a satisfied customer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My stay in Pullman was very impressive..I have no complaints..3 words for this hotel : luxury, comfortable and private..too bad I experienced all alone..it's amazing and complete to be with them in this hotel for my next visit..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All was begun with my mother, when she entered the hotel, she told me that this hotel made her feel so comfortable..and suddenly what she said feel so true on me when we walking around the hotel, met all the staffs, they all made the best and strong impression on me..I have no regret stay at this hotel..Will ask my children to try also and have the experience same like me..Thank you, Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic Pullman, I got my mood !It was great to stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia over the weekend with the pool area which are well maintained and convenience for sunbathing.Spoiled by many variety of foods at Sana Sini Restaurant, attentive and friendly staff.Really a mood booster! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Realized this hotel is so in to me. Happy to have experience in this hotel, Sana Sini showed their beautiful dishes, also all the staffs, treated me very well. I also enjoyed my day at Gym area. It was also my favourite. Pullman has their way to please me. Excellent for Pullman !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The room is very nice and spacious equipped with a small pantry, dining table and comfortable sofa. We love the bed with big and soft pillows and the kids also enjoyed the swimming pool. Breakfast was excellent with many variety of foods and the great service we received during breakfast time. The location of this hotel is perfect, walking distance to shopping malls. We definitely recommend this hotel for business travelers and weekenders.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

An excellent hotel with friendly staff and great facilities. The executive lounge team are particularly fantastic and do a great job at making you feel welcome, remembering your name etc. Would recommend the evening buffet in the downstairs restaurant, also a trip to the spa area. If you are an Accor member they do a good job of recognising this too. Can't recommend enough. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My friends and I really like to stay at Pullman Hotel Jakarta, no doubt to say as an excellent hotel. The service of this hotel was excellent also in its service, the friendly service that I got from the reservation section to the bellman service (PURWONO JOYO as a senior bellman) they are really knows how to serve the guests well. Cleanliness and friendly service made us go back to this hotel again to stay on the next trip. PULLMAN hotel is the best for the best hotel choice, EXCELLENT !!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Clean room with good service and good location of the hotel. The lobby feels so convenient, especially second floor area, very private and good surrounding..feels like home !Will be back to this hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First the positive, I like the hotel's atmosphere from the time I enter the lobby. The location is really good, we can use the crossing bridge to Plaza Indonesia. For me the highlight of the hotel is the breakfast at Sana Sini. Now the negative. The room size is a bit too small compared with the other 5 stars hotel nearby. I'm not sure if there is a problem with PLN or something, but I experience several blackouts during my stay (at least 3x). The longest was during night time on my 2nd night there, which was around 20-30mins. Everything was off including the lift, and fortunately I was not inside the lift that time. I was not expecting this at all from a 5 stars hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hotel in Central Jakarta is located perfectly. Grand Indonesia, Skye and Cloud Bar are in walking distance. Service is perfect and friendly, Breakfast dinner just wow.I can really recommend the Hotel, nothing was missing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is very well located hotel, right in the heart of CBD. Malls are located right across the street from the hotel, so if you are in the mood to shop, you're in the right location.The concierge service at the hotel is just fabulous.The breakfast buffet at the hotel is out of the world with multiple cuisines to chose from. I must thank Mr. Hari, you went out of the way, to ensure we got some amazing vegetarian options for breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great service as always at Pullman Jakarta.Special thanks to Lia and Dodi for the upgrade and being so nice during my stay!Room was great and location is excellent in the center of Jakarta.See you soon!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here last week for business, booked the room at the hotel website and happy to get better price. The lobby is modern and spacious yet the service is always warm and friendly. The greeters at the door and the check in were all very helpful. I was offered an upgrade and I'm glad i took it. The grand deluxe room is probably the best room out there. It's so worth the money spent with more space, standalone bathtub and comfortable bed. I also like the design, somehow i feel right at home.Every morning i had breakfast at Sana Sini. Hands down to the best breakfast ever in Jakarta. The staffs greeted me by name which is amazing considering the size of this hotel. Thank you Octa and Sugeng for the help every morning. Food is out of this world and truly a great way to start my day everyday. The healthy options are great, granola muesli and gluten free, so there's something for everyone there. I had dinner one evening and the crab promotion is too good to be missed. I enjoyed the singapore chili crab very much. Thanks Chef Sam for introducing the food and for the electrifying smiles.The pool and gym are great with complete facilities. Make time for some exercise here, won't regret it. There is a bar near the elevator and i had a few drinks there too. The place is nice and somewhat private.Overall i had a super stay. Thanks Vikri, Sari at the lobby and Erik who helped me for an errand so efficiently. You are all awesome. I will be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Either for business trip or family getaway, this hotel offered a lot of great stuff and services. Well resourcefull to support any business activities, or dine-in experience. The hotel atmosphere were warm, secured, child-friendly and comfy too. We love the pool which temperature was maintained perfectly. And their breakfast were plenty start from local food, chinese, japanese and western cuisine. It located in Jalan M.H Thamrin [ Business District ] nearby Bundaran Hotel Indonesia, which were next to Grand Indonesia Mall and Plaza Indonesia Mall [ 5-minute-walk ]. Thus, my business schedule could get along well with my family.The Price ? It was worthed. I would come here again for sure with my family if i need some time off.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for 3 nights on business, the room was small but comfortable. Check in was a breeze, as was check out. They even have a selection of pillows - being pregnant the maternity pillow really helped me sleep comfortably. The breakfast was really good!!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In our first room I think that previous guest was smoker and when we inform it , hotel management changed our room immediately with larger and non-smoked one . Thanks ...Breakfasts was also wonderful , all type of foods from Indonesia , India, China, Japan , Europe were available and location of the hotel was perfect . It is easy to reach all big Mall's . Staffs were always smiling and helpful...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel PullmanMarch 28 - 31, 2017Purpose:I booked this hotel for my business trip. The reason why I booked this hotel is because of its proximity in the city. It is smacked right in the middle of the center of Jakarta. Location:Near the nice shopping places (8 min walk to Sarinah where you can buy plenty of souvenir items). Tanah Abang Market is quite far from this hotel but is a very good shopping place for just about any item that you need (just be mindful of your things). The hotel is right across big shopping malls in central jakarta so there are plenty of options for food and shopping.Room:Modern and very spaciousWifi: Worked very well within the room and within the hotel premises.Staff:They were all very courteous, nice and attentive.Breakfast Buffet:As always with any 5-star hotel, food were aplenty and delicious.Downside:1. Meeting areas/roomThey do not have meeting rooms that can be used by hotel occupants.We were even barred from at the 2nd lounge (sofas) for a quick discussion with our local contact even when there wasn't anybody using the whole 2nd floor. We end up going to their cafe/restaurant for a more comfortable discussion.2. My room was facing the road which even at night you can hear loud sirens every now and then. So if you want complete tranquility, book a room facing the city and not the main road.Overall, I had a fantastic stay in this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In each visit the hotel staff were consistently giving a very warm welcome, I never feel like a stranger, the staff very attentive as always into the need and sincere smile from Filipus, Wandaka. No discrimination, i feel free to exchange the jokes the whole staff are friendly and never failed me thank you Arvi for the last minute offered, Salem who always make me laugh and remembering my need patiently during B'fast, Pak Pur who assist my Lugagge and the house keeper whose in-charge the room neatly and spotless and of course the back Room Staff, thank you all. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel really lives u to the Pullman standards for a business stay, coupled with its great location (within walking distance proximity to both Grand Indonesia and Indonesia Plaza), making the stay very convenient and comfortable.Will definitely be returning to stay here the next time am in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was here for 6 days. The room is not too big. They have a gym. The restaurant offers several food choices. They have a big conference room. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Overall, I will recommend this place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was booked Superior room for my stay and they offer me upgrade to Grand Deluxe for additional IDR 500.000 only. The room was very different so I decide to took the opportunity to upgrade. The room was very nice, facing Sudirman road so we can see the traffic at evening. The breakfast was very nice as well, a lot of option that you can choose. Will stay again in this hotel for my next trip.My booking was on Saturday night, so in the next morning there was CFD (Car Free Day) along Sudirman - Thamrin road. Very nice for morning run or just morning walk, a lot of food stall as well. Shopping?? Just across the hotel there are Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia which you can find anything there. For business also good, it located in Jakarta central business district.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for the easter weekend and had an amazing experience. It was an almost perfect stay as always.I would like to say that everyone was always accommodating and helpful when needed. Thanks to all the waiters staff in Sana Sini restaurant and by the swimming pool with all the mini zoo. Sugeng was the best staff ever!We loved everything about the hotel, restaurant and will definitely return. This is the second year we have spent easter at the hotel and was the best so far and look forward to it all year long.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Went to try the spa services here and really glad I did. I had a wonderful afternoon, left there feeling totally relaxed and happy. Loved the customer service, everyone there was so polite and professional. I forgot her name, but the lady who assisted me was amazing . She helped me decide what was best massage for me, and she recommended the 90 minute traditional massage. Can't thank her enough for her expertise. I left the spa at exactly the time she told me I would when booking my appointment, I had her full attention. It's quite pricey but definitely worth it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at this hotel in March for 5 nights in a one bedroom apartment. Our rooms were clean,very spacious and comfortable. Buffet breakfast was enormous,offering food from several Asian countries.Lot of sitting areas for coffees or entertaining guests. Very good outdoor swimming pool. For us,we were very happy with our stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I Stayed for two nights in this wonderful Hotel for a Corporate meeting. Overall, my experience was positive. Start from when i walked in, the bellman Adi was really helpful and genuine in helping with my luggage. No problem at all during Check in process. I was up and running within minutes to my room. The housekeeping was really helpful and fast in bringing me a prayer rug and the dress when i asked. I have no complaint about the Wifi in the room it's been performing well for me during my stay. One minor dissatisfaction was, the room was a bit too small, Good thing i spent most of the time outside the room. However, the meeting room was spacious, and very well equipped. The food during the coffee break was excellent. Overall, One of the best hotel to stay in Jakarta. Need to consider upgrading the size of the room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

"I had an incredible stay in at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. The location is very good, right in the city center. Excellent service by the front office staff . There was a line when I check in, but less than 10 minutes I got my key, helped by Daniel. Some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's main Restaurant - Sana Sini, for the variety of food they offer. I tried the fresh noodle served by Chef Sam in the Chinese section, he's funny but very informative about the chinese food. The noodle is delicious, and the broth is very tasty. My only complaint about the Restaurant was that we have to pay for the water, and it's not free flow! But overall, very reasonably priced for a 5-star hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having 2 years membership of Spa & Wellness, i wanna give some review:Cleaning staff now working their job quite well to clean up the wet floor regularly on the Bath area. But the Jacuzzi ( Hot Tub ) need to have a quick maintenance since last month, the heater function not working well to make the water as warm as before, and there is 1 lamp-glass under the Hot Tub was broken. I also suggested to put an air freshener/ deodorizer in the bath spa area since the unpleasant smells from the water drainage sometimes quite strong and annoying.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i love the restaurant and the executive lounge. i would like to say thanks to all staff especially Filipus (GRO), and executive lounge team (tika, troy,angel, shelby and arvi)you were too kind and very helpful to me!i will come back soon!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a regular customer at Pullman Jakarta on Thamrin Road. My flight got delayed by 2.5 hours, though the hotel was booked through their ACCOR website with no payment, the room reservation was in tact.All my requests have been fulfilled: high floor, one big bed, except one. I have requested a non-smoking room. Though the room is definitely classified as non-smoking, but I could smell the smoke odor strongly in the room atmosphere. Guess the previous guest(s) did not honor the system.BF is excellent as usual, and I recommend that you have BF at this hotel and skip lunch elsewhere as this is very good.Other than that, I would compliment the front desk, as they were efficient and aware of us waiting at certain times. They care enough to get extra personnel to reduce the wait.Will definitely return, to a real non-smoking room, hopefully.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Visited with family totaling 6 rooms, arrived at the hotel by 3.30pm and had to face the appalling front office of my life. Namely Miss Wanda, Miss Sari, Miss Mega were the most inefficient bunch,more over I was able to see that they were more or less pretending to be stupid. It took me 90 minutes to check in which was a record time and the front office was empty for for the whole period.All the above is after corresponding over 7 emails with Miss Raditya Fauzia who is the reservation supervisor and mind you there was not a single request made through her were provided. What I required was that 2 baby cots were requested and rooms close to each other. Utter waste of my time to email such an inefficient supervisor.The staff at the door and the rooms service staff was excellent but the issue was taken up with Mr Erix though he said he was new and he apologized but why after my holiday was a real nightmare.The billing department too tried pulling a fast on me charging extra US $570 after showing the discrepancy,he then overcharges US $60 which does not show in my invoice which made me feel the front office is stifling money from Accor hotels when it is a cash payment. REAL SHAME ON ACCOR HOTELS.The air conditioning stops cooling from 2am until 5am which is strange.The hotel transportation company "panorama destinations" rips you royally charging us US600/- for 3 hour city tour which was utter waste. I do feel Accor management has to appoint a professional front office and accounts dept as they have a superb property with ideal location and the staff brings so much of disrepute to the Accor brand.Other Accor hotel I have visited, Sofitel- Los Angeles, shanghai, Dubai. Pullman Dubai, Novotel in over 10 cities.Will I visit again-never ever as plenty of options are available with Hyatt and kempinski opposite the Pullman 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed at Pullmann in Jakarta. very central location not far from the exibition centre, difficult to reach in the rush hours (but this is normal in Jakarta). the rooms are as big as a box of biscuits but very well equipped, nice small bathroom, confortable queen size bed and a small working table. the wifi quality is very good and definitely fast for business purposes. the restaurant located at the ground floor offering western and eastern food has got a very good tested quality and an excellent service. the breakfast assortment is outstanding, you can find anything you want, sweet and salty. there is a big outdoor swimming pool and a great, well equipped gym. the staff is showing a genuine interest towards the customer and it has been very well trained. most definitely this place has a very good value for money and I may surely come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewarded with an excellent location, the staff here does an outstanding job. The rooms are well maintained, the pool/gym/spa area is nice as well. The F&B quality is the only downside of an otherwise very recommendable place to stay. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel, Will be back soon,staff were great, i just didnt like traffic in the city jakarta, and dont fall for the taxi prices and always extra tips asked for, and oh yeah keep money in your pocket to give to the lads on the road or you will staying in taxi for the rest if the stay ...traffic litrelly dont move...coming back to the hotel each day alive was a blessing ..overrall great hotel Thank You 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located in the most busiest area in Jakarta, MH Thamrin street and overlooked by the iconic Bundaran HI for its best view. While I stayed here, I opted the room at the new tower, it's more spacious, and large compared to the ones at the old tower.Here's the deal, the traffic and the MRT construction straight in front of the hotel may give a loud noise so better pick a room facing other side (like their pool).The room I slept in is big enough with modern facility and the bathtub because you rarely seen in the most new business hotel here and the amenities is really good. Air conditioner worked well and fortunately we can choose our desired pillow to compliment our sleep.Inside the hotel, there's a pool and suitable for kids, along with gym, locker room completed with sauna, steam, jacuzzi, and cold plunge. My little complaint, we must walk straight up long around meeting room to the pool area so if there's a large group of people using meeting room, they can see us strolling wet with a cold chill from air conditioner. They better reconsider open the Azure room so we can take a shortcut walk to the pool.For beakfast, it's great, everything we needed is almost there and the servers are attentive to our request. Keep it up!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been a regular here for many years. It is well located in the main city and close to two big shopping malls. Travelling around is convenient. The hotel has a good and prompt housekeeping team.Over the years I have seen many of the friendly staff from the Guests Welcoming Team left after a short one or two years.. Luckily there are still many staff who will go out of their way to help make a good stay. I am glad to have very warm and caring friends like Avri, Shirley and Suci from the E Lounge. Of course my ever-helpful old friends Hari promoted in the cafe and Zemmie moving up from the doorman to the E Lounge. Good work Hari and Zemmie and glad that Management has recognised your good services to the guests. Ada is now the new friendly doorman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room was soo small. We made the booking through Accor membership (which there was a separate line), but it was so slow upon check in. The hotel was very crowded, because it was a new years eve. Overall it was an average stay, nothing special.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is definitely an above standard for Pullman!Good location.The service is great, rooms very clean, had a housekeeper named Dian who was very helpful and attentive, they are doing a very clean job!Breakfast great, cigar lounge perfect.Will definitely come back, no reason to look for another hotel in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excelent service starting check in to check out. Lobby , room and breakfast are superb ! My compliment goes to the Guest Relation , Filipus for providing me the best service possible. Thank you Pullman . I'll coming back soon !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the hotel for 10 days while traveling on business. My room was always clean and well stocked with water. The breakfast buffet had everything you could imagine and tasted fresh. But, it was the staff that makes this hotel impressive. From the moment I arrived very early in the morning until checking out late in the evening, the staff were friendly, attentive, courteous and helpful. They assisted me with locating a business contact outside of the city, helped move the many packages I had upon checking in, provided me with my favorite seat in the restaurant and insuring the taxi would take me to my work location. Pak Rusli at the bar talked with me not only about Bali wine, but life in Jakarta and Pak Nova always had the door open for me, not only to the hotel but any needs I may have. The staff makes this hotel 4 stars! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was chilling by the pool bar on the second floor. In the easy breezy, I was talking with the only bar staff, Suhadi, while having my drink. He was attentive, spontaneous and hilarious. He's the man! Also cheers to Ricky, Mima at the front desk and Filipus at the front door. Lovely experiences at PJI!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I only come to this hotel because of its very central location. I am aware about the long waiting times when checking in, I am also aware the front desk doesn't pick up the phone, I am aware about the rigid upgrade policies (platinums are nothing better than gold) Being an Accor platinum and having spend +25 nights at this hotel in 2016, they very well know my preferences. Despite my loyalty I was put in the worst and smallest room every, without standing shower (my Accor profile clearly shows standing shower). Once I entered my 200USD room, I started cleaning the showerhead which was clogged, I looked at the rotten bananas in the fruit plate, I smelled the cigarette smoke coming out of the aircon, then called the duty manager from the toilet seat in the bath room (because the telephone in the bedroom wasn't working). The duty manager came to the room and suggested I may want to move to a "different room category" insinuating a higher price. There goes my mood into negative. I ask him to call me back in two hours. At midnight he called me confirming he had a room with a standing shower. I told him I wish to sleep and asked him to call me the next morning. The next morning another duty manager called me and told me that the executive room is ready and the bell boy would give me the keys in the executive lounge. I packed up and went to the lounge. There again another duty manager (the 3rd one) then told me that I had to stay in my room because none of the other duty managers had authorized a room change. Since he did not believe my story I told him to reach out to the 2 other duty managers. Number one was woken up and had a sudden memory loss and could not remember that he had promised a complementary room change. He suggested I should pay for the move. Number two was on a motorbike and could not be reached. Number 3 was not willing (or was not allowed) to take any decision. the only thing he said was "I understand the room is not according to your expectations" - pure provocation. Not even an apology, nothing. How I dare to ask for a better room. I was left fuming and went back with my luggage to my crappy room full of cigarette smoke, with a dirty showerhead and a non working telephone. Remember, I have platinum status and I am very loyal guest to this hotel. I left for my meetings, came back in the afternoon and asked the reception if a new better room was assigned. They told me that another same type (without standing shower) had been allocated. Pure provocation, because the occupancy rate was around 70% and plenty of much better rooms could have been allocated. I immediately checked out and left the hotel for the Raffles hotel in Jakarta. I told them my story and I promptly received apologies for the bad behaviour of a sister property and was compensated with a free massage. To finish this sad story: Two weeks earlier I checked into the same Pullman Thamrin and had to leave after 2 hours because of an emergency. I checked out and since I did not use the room at all I requested for a discount which was denied and the full rate was charged.I was told that the hotel owner puts enormous pressure on the operator (Pullman)and to strictly comply with all form of Accor benefits and for sure not to give more than they should even in cases of "recovery" (I don't believe they understand the meaning of the word "recovery"). As such spending 40 nights as a platinum in this property won't get you anything better in terms of room upgrade than a gold member spending his first night, even if you face major problems. The only bright light in this hotel are the staff in the executive lounge. I have seen tremendous improvement in both service and food and beverage the lounge.Final statement: In Jakarta, Pullman does not represent the quality you expect, try out the (Grand) Mercure hotels, better rooms and better service at half the price. For a little more you can go to the Fairmont, which is superb both in quality and service, then you have the Raffles, which is simply another world and worth every extra dollar.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I just come back home, Korea from Jakarta. I had stayed at Pullman hotel from 27th to 30th March as business trip.Even though I had many oversea business trips, it's the first time to visit Jakarta. All staff members of Pullman hotel are basically so kind. Especially, Miss Wulan's kindness made a strong impression on me. I would like to give thanks again to her on this page.Also you will get a surprise when you enter breakfast buffet, because there're so many various food with approx 23 USD$.I think if you stay this hotel, you have no regrets.I'm starting to have a good feeling on Indonesia.Thanks a lot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I booked this hotel as it was directly opposite a conference venue but much cheaper then that hotel. When hotels are reasonably priced, I usually don't expect that much. But I was blown away by how great the service was at Pullman hotel. From the moment you enter the hotel, everyone from the doorman to the receptionist to the waiter are really friendly. The hotel looks like a five star hotel. Rooms were great and room service was also good. The highlight will have to be the buffet breakfast. What an amazing spread! From Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, western to Vietnamese food! I would stay here again next time I am in Jakarta and will highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Spacious and comfortable public areas. Very good service. I upgraded to the tower for an extra $25 and was very happy with the room which had a large bathroom with a separate freestanding bathtub which seemed inviting though I am a shower person. The dinner buffet, while not inexpensive, was probably one of the best I have ever seen with multiple stations of many different types of food - all of good quality. It was impossible to sample even a fraction of the dishes. The included with the room breakfast buffet was also very expansive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is located in the heart of Jakarta, close to two large shopping malls. The food selection in the restaurant is very good, with a buffet not to be missed. The staff are knowledgeable and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are a nice standard, although a little on the small side. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for 2nites over the weekend.We got one of a credit card promo and got our room upgraded into deluxe room (too bad I forgot to take pictures of the room).Our 2 boys (7 and 5 y.o) enjoyed the spacious room a lot.I was at first worry that without the kids club, the kiddos will got bored and we will all end up have to go to the mall across the street; but nooo, the kids enjoy every bit of it in the room. The swimming pool is big enough with cozy cabanas (or something like that) for us to lazing around.The hotel also have spa, fitness center, sauna/whirlpool/steam room.The restaurant - Sana Sini have always been one of my favorite resto. The food variety is simply amazing, from japanese,western,chinese,desserts, and even a wide variety of indonesia food. U can find many kind of satays here and they all taste delicious!They have this kids corner available during sunday brunch, and my kids enjoyed the activities provided there.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Oh and on sunday morning, we can join the CarFreeDay activity just outside the hotel.Overall, we'd love to come again!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I rate this hotel as excellent.Apart from its central location,the buffet breakfast is amaz ing,service outstanding,rooms very clean and modern and amenities more than adequate.Would highly recommend this hotel for either leisure or business and will definitely book it for my future visits to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed five nights in March and was delightfully impressed with the helpfulness of the staff. I needed to book a train ticket and could not do so before the trip because of the Indonesian system, but the concierge went out of its way to book a ticket for me in advance. When I arrived, I was greeted with smiles and offers to help with arrangements. My many thanks for the helpfulness of the staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

starting from the lobby to the rooms, it is the best ive been in jakarta. service was great also. location is great. cross the street and you are in the best mall. i used their van to bring me to the airport and the driver was courteous. will definitely come back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my second time visiting the Pullman CBD Thamarin in the Grand Deluxe Room for 4 nights. I have to say that I really enjoy the service and the rooms here. If you have the Le Club Accor membership Gold status and above you are surely to be offered an upgrade to the Deluxe apartment suite, which I was offered on my last two nights due to full occupancy on my first two. I decided to move back to the Grand Deluxe though smaller but had a newer feel, plugs were more equipped, and overall seemed to feel more comfortable. Don't get me wrong the Deluxe apartment is nice but as it says it's for more long stay use so their is mini kitchen and washing machine [might be more suitable for families with children] but I just wasn't feeling and like I said it's a bit older as it's in the older building.My recommendations here would be their breakfast and dinner buffets...wide selection of food and attentive staff. The fitness, Jacuzzi, and steam rooms are great! You need to check them out if you have time!Location wise amazing! Right in the heart of Jakarta with lots of shopping and dining places! Downsides : Because I moved around [switching rooms] a few times the system got mixed up and for some reason my card wasn't working and my room wasn't made... was a little surprised by that but I understood the situation. Other things to note : Know that if you are calling an Uber not sure about taxis to the hotel lobby everytime you leave the hotel you will need to pay a 5000 Rupiah fee for having the uber pass through the gates as a fee... That became a bit annoying . Also note since this is in the heart Traffic can become quite bad so plan your trips wisely!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been staying at Pullman since 20014 and the service is absolutely fantastic. From the moment I am met at the airport by the hotel representative to the moment I check out I am pampered. all the Food and beverage outlets serve fantastic food and the serviceis excellent. The room amenities are better than in other 5 star hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This 5 stars hotel in Thamrin area was great, helpful staff, they let me early check in :)Room was spacious, clean & neat. Bed and pillow was superb comfortable. Free wifi. The bathroom also spacious, clean, there's separate shower room, toilet and bathtub.The breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant was superb delicious. They also provide free parking for guests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Exec. Lounge opens at 6am - it should be ready for operation at 6am.. not 6.25. Fifteen minutes for hot plate and most of buffet missing at 6.10.. Overall, staff are friendly and the location is good. Chocolat bar- pleasant. Gym good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta at CBD is located smack in the middle of Jl Thamrin a place where you could find two great malls ie Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia various other 5 star hotels eg Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, Kempenski etc. The rooms of the hotel are clean and linens thoroughly wash and neatly pressed and pillows of various sizes are arranged to cater to many sleeping habits.However, it seems that of late (I stayed there from March 7th-10th and March 13th-14th) the room charges have been rather steep even for early bookings and the buffet lunch although it was elaborate did not serve any drinks on the house. Guests are expected to order drinks from their menu which is of course rather costly as well. For frequent patrons such as myself, it was rather shocking to see that I was served a used, half-filled sparkling water upon first entering to my room. That was really really shocking to see that their house-keeping could make such a big goof-up! The small tit-bits and local pastries served looks delicious but I wasn't sure how long the food was left there exposed to the environment. So folks at Pullman - pls buckle up to continue to remain as one of my favourite hotels in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main asset of the Pullmann is its central location. The hotel resides in an older building, but has been renovated to a modern and rather stylish place. Service is good and the breakfast buffet enormous. The only downside is the size of the rooms, which are on the small side. Other than that, they are quite acceptable.If you are staying in Jakarta and don't need huge rooms, the Pullmann is a good choice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I come every month to this hotel and the staff is very friendly. They always help me if need something special.The rooms are very clean, fancy design and quite. Gym is one of the best compared to other hotels in Jakarta. They have own instructors who can help you on all equipment. There is also a clean and nice sauna. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic it offers you continental, Chinese, local Indonesian and Japanese food. The bar and the restaurant are top level in Jakarta with many guests who not even stay in this hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

AS an Accor platinum member and a regular visitor to the Pullman Jakarta CBD, I was disappointed in the service that I received. I requested an up grade to a larger room and all I received was some complementary chocolates and a small fruit basket. Whilst the person I was traveling with who is not an Accor member or regular visitor to the Pullman received an upgrade to a mini suite. No it is not sour grapes but I did expect better service..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location and service, it's just that we didn't notice it got 2 different wings, one with the luxury feels, the other one seems rundown already. Our relatives (guests) gets the nicer room & alley. Ours was look older, bathroom had mildew smell, and was filled with mold. Overall, it was a nice stay, as their staff treated us well. And the breakfast was superb. A feast to be exact! And to note that you have to pay for the airport transport. Which I normally gets it free from any of 5-stars hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When I go to Jakarta, I like to stay near the Grand Indonesia Mall, which is centrally located, good places to eat, and close to most of my customers. This was the first time I stayed at Pullman Jakarta, and I must say it was a nice surprise. I arrived late at night, had an issue with my passport - lost it in the airport -, and the staff at that moment made a plan to look for it first thing in the morning, together with their airport representative. They really cared about my rest, would have meetings in the morning.Around 8:30am, I received a call from the hotel saying the passport was found, and was going to be delivered in the hotel in that afternoon.Great job from the staff!Also one of the best breakfast, incredible variety! The room is not a big one, but comfortable, with good and uncomplicated Internet access.Great option for business!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was recommended by my business associates to stay in this hotel. And I am glad I did.Located in the CBD area, it was very convenient. Having said that, some degree of traffic woes is expected in Downtown Jakarta. Room was the Grand Deluxe Room. Between the bedroom and bathroom is glass instead of a wall. You have full view of what is inside the bathroom. Fortunately there is window blinds that you can use if you prefer privacy.What was interesting is the buffet breakfast spread. They have food from different cultures. The Japanese food section was really good.Service was good and consistent throughout. Security is usual as what you expect in Indonesia. They screen all cars before allowing you into the hotel.Will be back when I next return to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located near the Welcome Monument (Bundaran HI), this hotel offers a perfect location. Office buildings are just within walking distance, and for shopping you have Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia which are located next to one another. The Superior Room with queen size bed is not huge but it is quite comfortable for one person stay. You can watch TV to relax or surf the internet through Wi-Fi connection. What I like the most is the breakfast, they offer various types of cuisines, from Indonesian, Western, Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese, Chinese and many more. Price wise is not cheap, but it is cheaper than nearby hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be disappointed with myself if i did not write this comment as soon as possible and finally i have the time to spare now.I used to stay in this hotel when it was formerly known as Nikko Hotel. However, i have to say that my stay with Pullman from 23rd to 25th Feb 2017 was much more magnificent, right from the time we arrived and the entrance and left after 3 days there.The staff, from the doorman up to the cleaners, they are very attentive, professional, caring and always there for us. The service was superb and excellent that i feel sad to leave. Breakfast, oh my god!!!, we can skip lunch after that.There are others who regretful i can't remember their names but these two ladies, Miss Mariska and Miss Wulan, there both were awesome and the service the gave with the smiles make me wonder if they ever feel sad in their life. It was a warm and genuine smile.Congrat's to Pullman's Management for having such a wonderful staffs and for sure i will be back and for sure i will recommend this hotel. Trust me, NO REGRET AT ALL!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect hotel to stay in Jakarta during a business trip. Right across Plaza Indonesia. Great breakfast buffet with many different cuisines. Large, clean and modern rooms. Nice and kind staff.Thanks Dian for perfectly tidying up my room during the stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I got upgraded this time as a member of the group. So, I got a super nice VIP room. Everything is new, clean and nice with a capsule coffee machine in the room! I love it and hopefully I get it again next time. Breakfast is great and too much to choose from. Staff is super friendly and willing to help. I think it is extremely great value for its location and service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at the new wing where the rooms are swanky and love it cos it's really comfortable. Near to the shopping mall grand Indonesia with loads of restaurants. Friendly staff and breakfast spread was awesome 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed one night here in February and lived this hotel- it will now be my Jakarta "go to". The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, good air conditioning, fabulous location with many places for dinner and shops if you need that. The workout facilities and pool are also nice. The breakfast was incredible. I wish I'd brought a bigger appetite! Very sweet and attentive staff in all parts of the hotel. I will be back- highly recommend for business or family trips!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is very strategic either for business purpose or vacation. I think that factor made people choose this hotel. The staffs were very professional, and the room was very modern and clean, although the size of the room was choking. With the same budget, I could find better hotel nearby.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lobby is amazing, gym is great, breakfast spread is impressive. BUT- Room is realllllly small (took the standard room) and too small for my liking. If you have a luggage beyond the cabin size, it will be a challenge in the standard room.Honestly, Won't recommend this place unless you are not fussy about space. Doesn't seem very worth the $. But this is the most affordable hotel around the Roundabout.The room service is pretty basic, nothing too fancy or elaborate. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Extremely central, so you can access a nice shopping mall on the other side of the street. The hotel is how you would like a hotel to be: large lounge, nice cafè, nice resaturant. The room was gorgious, extremely spacious, with everything in. And the bathroom extremely comfortable with a large bath and a window on the room. Room service of high level.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at this hotel for 3nights. I was upgraded to a premier superior room which was only slightly larger than the standard. Windows were full of condensation so couldn't see much. I would ask for a room at the rear next time as the road is noisy all the time. The only bad part was that the shower and bath had a lot of black mould in the sealant and upon showering the floor would be covered in water from the leaking tiles. Fairly pricy when compared to other Pullman hotels. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having stayed in a number of Pullman hotels, Pullman-Jakarta definitely does not disappoint. In fact, it was better than expected.Right from the lobby to the room, the hotel was tastefully decorated.The staffs were friendly and helpful, especially those in the buffet-breakfast who made me ginger-coffee in a takeaway cup as I had to rush for a meeting.The Chocolate-bar has the best chocolate I have tasted. The breakfast-buffet spread was enormous with all the right fresh juices. The gym equipment is well maintained and very importantly, clean!Thank you for making my stay a great one!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What I loved:- Location, location, location. Close to business district, malls (shopping, restaurants), clubs / bars- One of the best and most varied breakfast buffets I have seen. And the Sana Sini restaurant starts the breakfast at 5:30am, for early risers- Staff were quite efficient and friendly- The hotel accommodated our request for early check-in and late check-out. Of course, it helped that this was a business hotel on a weekendWhat could have been better:- Not any glaring issues, but I did get a whiff of smoking in the elevators sometimes. They can do better in making sure non-smoking guests are not inconvenienced- The room was perfect for us, but some guests might prefer a bit more space
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You guys did great, everything from our arrival to our departure was perfect. We usually visit Shang properties, and this time the change we made was great. Your service Sari at the front desk and everyone at the breakfast was fantastic. Even the barrister did his best to make a perfect cappuccino with perfect designs. Thank you for a wonderful birthday cake and recommendations on spa facilities too. Kudos to you all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I will rate this hotel Good! Hotel location centrally located and next to mall. Breakfast buffet is AMAZING! Not so good: 1. the room and bathroom are small. 2. not generous / flexible. I booked it through travel aggregator site and booked with breakfast inclusive. but by mistake instead of 2 person i booked with one person. (my fault) If i have to compare Marriott and Hyatt "I don't think" the price difference matters if 1 or 2 person staying including breakfast. so i was charged for 2nd person having breakfast. 3. I didn't find bed/ mattress to be comfortable. Overall Pullam is a good hotel coz I loved my stay in Bangkok Pullman. I think Pullman in Jkt should keep price competitive based on size of the rooms and shouldn't overly confuse customers with its marketing tactics.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Im an accor gold member holder. I've got upgraded into the next room category but i didnt satisfy with it, then i must wait about 2 Hours until i get other room. After that it was all perfect! Hotel staffs are all very kind, they great us always with smile and very helpful. The Restaurant Sana Sini provide great food, maybe their staff should be more able to speak english, it was not always easy to order something. But all in all im very satisfied. And the hotel location is very strategic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I must say, Pullman Jakarta Thamrin has always welcome me as a VVIP at the hotel. I have to compliment the excellent services provided by the staff at SanaSini restaurant, Ms. Marlina. She have made my dining experience at SanaSini restaurant a memorable one and I would definetly return back to Pullman Jakarta Thamrin. Also, great customer services at the Executive Lounge, Ms. Angel have made my visits to the lounge a memorable and welcoming. However, there is still a shortfall at the Pullman Jakarta Thamrin. The wifi connection was poor despite raising this issue during my previous stay. No improvement as yet. I would love to experience an improvement with the hotel wifi connection and speed for my upcoming stay in March 2017. Overall, I am very happy and feel welcome by the Pullman Jakarta Thamrin and look forward in my next stay in March 2017. Thank you Pullman and Le Club Accor Hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Check-in - the lobby was very beautiful, the check in counters were quite unique. Check-in was also quite fast. You should take note that there are 2 wings and to check with them which elevator to take. I was pointed to the wrong side by their service staff in the lobby. Room - modern looking but small. it will be quite a squeeze for 2 with luggage, thankfully for me i was alone. air con was too damn cold, i ended up having to turn it off just to keep from freezing. Wifi - stable connection, quite fast. Event venue - we did our marketing roadshow here and I was quite impressed with the setup of the event room. refreshments were also well prepared. Location - conveniently located across the road from Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Short taxi ride away from some nice restaurants. Overall I quite liked the location of this place. Breakfast - probably the widest spread ever. even the boss agrees with this comment and he has stayed at a lot of hotels from all his business trips and conferences over the past so many years. the only thing i noticed is that they don't change the menu. it was the same over the 2 days we were there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I was very satisfied with the kind and nice service of the staff.From the lobby, all the staff was very friendly and smiley.Everything was also good in the room except the carpet.I am allergic to dust a little. A little means usually I don't feel uncomfortable at the most of the hotel room carpet.But, this time my eye became red and very irritating.I first thought I got eye infection, since my trip schedule was very busy and tight.And, I was even thinking that I got Zika.It was not because of my schedule or Zika, but because of the room carpet.Everytime I am out, my eye became good. And after I checked out, I didn't get the symptom again.I am not 100% sure that was because of the carpet.But, other than that, I cannot find any reason for my eye proble.So maybe I am wrong, and in that case, I am sorry for Pullman Jakarta in advance.But, I hope Pullman Jakarta cleans room carpet more perfectly.Except that, it was very enjoyable stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My check in was fast and full hospitality. Only one issue in reservations with hotel.com an error on wep page got room not included break fast and pay an charge rent breakfast included.Deluxe room is very small. Security is great. Need to confirm your reservations detail before checkup.enjoyed staying and location is great.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed four days on business in February 2017. Hotel has great facilities and all staff provide an amazing service. The rooms themselves are quite small, but very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Breakfast buffet was included with the room and had a great range of international foods, breads, hot dishes, fruits, juices and coffees (try the ginger coffee for something different). There is also a dinner buffer with a huge range of foods from around the world (lost count of the number of counters), though it runs a little expensive at ~AUD50 equivalent. The staff were incredibly attentive and quickly learned your preferences (coffee, water etc). Was travelling with a colleague who had stayed at Pullman previously and they even remembered him from his previous trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great service, Dian did an amazing job with cleaning my room everyday. Can only recommend it! Very clean rooms, good food, everything 100% top quality. Stayed here on business for 4 days and it was the best hotel and service i experienced.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is well appointed, close to shops, restaurants and businesses.The facilities are quite good and although the rooms are small they are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is superior catering for a diverse range of tastes and diets. One of the most impressive aspects of the hotel is the staff who are very willing to provide you with excellent service. During my stay a couple of employees stood out - Zemmy. and Mariska. Both these employees exuded passion and enthusiasm for their job demonstrating a welcoming, engaging and customer oriented approach. It's employees like Zemmy, Mariska and the rest of the team that really make the difference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were on a business trip and stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is ideal for business stays with lots of dining and shopping options nearby. Compared to the other 5 star hotels in the neighborhood, Pullman is real value for money and the hotel rates are extremely attractive for this centrally located hotel. Breakfast buffet is loaded with choices and the breakfast table has a mini-map of buffet locations inside the restaurant based on different food choices available (Indonesian, Japanese, Western, Indian, Chinese....). Rooms are clean and the service is good. Thanks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are enjoying our stay very nice large room facing city view , many nice places to eat & hangout , gym and swimming pool fantastic, v nice and friendly , helpfull staff . Filipus is a nice staff i knew ! Keep up a good work . 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm, friendly, and homey atmosphere as usual from the Pullman Thamrin team for our family.Wonderful meals at sana-sini.No fuss online booking, check-in & check-out; all requests during online booking were duly noted and fulfilled.Quite a nice surprise this time we had a street view room.And for me a perfect location to start a jog to Jakarta's old city area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From the moment I walked in I knew I had booked a nice place to stay. The rooms were comfortable. The staff were all nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet is OMG.. The best.. The pool area was spectacular. My children loved the place. Walking distance to Grand Indonesia which had a nice food court also.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a short stay here but everything was great. The breakfast buffet was amazing - so many different dishes from Idonesian, Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine. The staff was friendly and accommodating. On our last day we had to head to the airport very early, and they prepared a hot breakfast box for us to take on the go at no extra cost. We had a very comfortable stay!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for a night while on transit. This is an extremely busy hotel that you can observed right from the moment you walked in. Front desk staff are extremely polite, friendly and professional but otherwise extremely busy with the high volume of guests. I thought, perhaps the queue for checking in could have been better organised to ensure guests that they are not left unattended. The room I checked in was small, but packed with superb facilities! I stressed here again that since this is a very busy business hotel, cleanliness of rooms may not be as expected to the fussy. Guests who pay for his/her rooms from their own pocket would expect the best from the 5-star hotel; but business travellers whose rooms are being paid for by companies may not be that fussy. Overall, this is a great hotel but definitely taken its toll from the high volume of guests checking in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a frequent traveller and I have stayed in more than 7 hotels just in the month of Dec 2016 alone. I would like to say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in for the service I have experienced.Special mention would be Zemmy from the front desk. He communicated with me with sincerity and makes his guest feel really at home with his excellent hospitality and politeness. He made sure all my needs and problems were met from the point I checked in till the point where I boarded the taxi to the airport. The frontdesk reception service was good…however, Zemmy’s was exceptional.The other staff I would like mention is Harris who is in the valet. I have ordered an uber to send me to the airport. However, all the uber drivers I have tried did not know how to enter the hotel. He stayed with me throughout the wait and he even tried to help me call and message the Uber divers for instruction. He eventually booked a taxi for me when the uber bookings were not successful. He was really polite and patient even though it was a busy period.It was a short stay but Zemmy and Harris has made me feel like a truly honoured and welcomed guest. There’s something different in the way they interact with their guests. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for two nights on a business trip. It is a good value hotel in business district with all the amenities of a business hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful - welcome and check-in is excellent. Room on the pool side of the building was quiet was everything I needed at a good room rate. I would prefer proper tea/coffee cups to the paper cups provided. The pool is very nice and I enjoyed a swim with only a couple of other people there. Extensive breakfast buffet with lots of choice. I had a light dinner from the a la carte menu that was very nice although more expensive than expected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room is very good and clean. And the breakfast is great!! You can choose what you like, western food, japanese food, indonesian food and many more. The place is very nice, its in central business area so my bf can easier to go to do his business and also easy for to go to shopping centre. I only need walking to the Plaza Indonesia or Grand Indonesia. There also good bar or club. We went to the sky bar in plaza indonesia and the imigrant club. Over all is my the best experience to staying in the hotel. Id would like to come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall satisfactory but it did not exceed my expectation. Upon arrival, the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was a decent size, although not the cleanest I've stayed in. There was a lock of hair by the bath, as well as some visible dust and dirt in the corners.The bed was a little bit too springy to my liking. The wifi was efficiently fast and easy to use. The breakfast was fantastic, but again, not the cleanest dining tables I've seen. We loved that there were so many TV channels to choose from in different languages.However, we found the lack of electrical outlets extremely unhelpful. The biggest issue was the bathroom door. It didn't have a lock, and it was not possible to shut it properly, resulting in massive gaps on either side of the door. Privacy was minimal.Aside from these issues, the hotel is situated in a very central and convenient location. We would probably choose to stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed during a brief business trip in Jakarta. I had heard both very positive and some less positive feedback on the Pullman Jakarta.Overall a great experience. The property itself is very nice - love the huge, well decorated lobby. Very nice gentlemanly bar - great wine list and they make a mean side car. Bintang beers all round! Great pool too on the roof.The only downside was some of the rooms have what looks to be mold/mildew all around the window. This was consistent in one of my colleagues rooms also - but not the other.Great little spot in Jakarta! Worth the stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Have been staying at Pullman Jarkata for a few times. Absolutely love this hotel, it's super spacious and clean with modern designs located at the heart of Jarkata. It's next to The biggest shopping mall Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia.The breakfast choices were great and staffs were friendly and helpful. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has everything you need. An olympic size swimming pool, well-decorated rooms with comfy mattress and even bathtub at all rooms. The choice of breakfast was plenty and tasted so yummy. I actually stayed there twice and won't hesitate to come back. Highly recommended!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a platinum member of accor hotels and senior tourist, this is the worst pullman hotel I ever seen. I chose this hotel because of the location, however it only has good location, nothing elseI spent more than 1 hour to check in, from 3 to 5 pm, after the long trip from abroad to Indonesia and the another crowd trip from airport to the hotel. I have to say it is the worst choice of me to let this pullman as the 1st hotel of my Indonesia trip.3 men explainned to me about one thing: why the hotel could not provide breakfast and other benefits of accor platinum member even I showed the printted confirmation mail from accorhotels.com. they do not believe my reservation from accor and they told me because my price (100 USD) is lower than the limit (115USD). they still refused to provide the benefits even I told them to pay as the limit of 115USD which is their own limit- definition by this hotel. I felt tired of the processed and then I told them to go away to stay at grand hyatt hotel which is on the opposite side, then they told me to provide the breakfast.Thank god I only need to stay at this hotel just one night!After 5pm I went to my room after checking in, I saw a Japanese old man very nauseous gallant with a woman from 2nd floor to 9th floor in the lift, I believe he was staying with a hooker, the woman is between 20 to 30 however the old man is more than 50! why couldnt they do that when in the room??The room is very small and old, I think it does not worth 100 USD, even does not worth 50USD. much worse than the other hotels I stayed in the next several days in Jakarta.The breakfast which pullman "gift" to me only allowed to eat in executive lounge, the tast was good.I was refused to use E vouchers of accor hotels with the same excuse- your price is 100USD, lower than 115USD. And I was suggestted to stay again to enjoy all the benefits of accor platinum members if my price is above 115USD. I told them that was my finnal time staying at this hotel because it is so disappointted, I stayed at accor hotels many nights every year and this pullman is the worst one I ever seen.The terrible room and sad service-2 hours for checking in, 1 hour for checking out, full of excuses no goodness for guestsI don't think this hotel does deserve PULLMAN this brand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear General Manager,I would like to thank you for all service during my stay at your hotel, Pullman Jakarta. 9 January 2017.Room is clean and comfort. Breakfast is spectacular with variety choices.Special thank you for Mr. Riyan Ali for upgrade my room and your kindness. Also, thank you for Mr. Harris for taking care of my luggage. Overall, stay at Pullman Hotel is unforgettable memories. Best value for money. Vielen Dank für alles. Ich wünsche alle die Beste für Ihre Hotels.Auf Wiedersehen.Best Regards,Ichsan Akmal Mazas
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a spanking new hotel but everything is so well-maintained and well run.The location is excellent as it is in the middle of high-end shopping district. For business traveller, I feel this hotel suits me really well. With big open spaces, there are plenty of nooks and corners for business meetings. The staff were excellent and tried to cater to everything that a guest needs.The check-in was smoothly done even though we had special instructions in place. We were upgraded which was always a very pleasant surprise.Tried most of the facilities there. The gym is fully equipped with a very attentive, personalize lovely fitness trainer. The Spa was lovely and massage was satisfying. I thought the sauna, steam and jacuzzi was not hot enough for the ladies however I was told that the men's facilities were nicely hot.Buffet was excellent with plenty of varieties with a really good Japanese spread section. Kudos to the team from check-in to housekeeping to room service. Will return again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I visited this hotel almost 3 years ago, this was one of its kind. Modern, uneek of its kind. Then it was brand new. Now after 3 years I go back again, amazingly to see that they have managed to keep it to its original status. Well done
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Unbeatable location in the heart of the city. With Jakarta traffic its nice to be near your meetings unless you plan on spending half your time stuck in a jam. Hotel itself is great. Well appointed, elegant, rooms are not super spacious but adequate for the average. Breakfast buffet is vast so if you can't find something to eat..there's something wrong with you. The restaurant also seems very popular with local high society types of ladies lunches and family dinners. Great cocktail bar for a quiet evening located at the far end of the main lobby.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed : 2016Duration : 7 nights; Non-smoking Superior Room w 2 Single BedsSummary : Superb hotel for the business traveller*** The Good ***- Excellent room with strong water pressure from shower-head & consistent flow of hot water. Strong toilet flush, unlikely to choke unless you try to put half a toilet paper roll into it at one go.- Centrally-located in the business district just across the road from Central Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia.- Superb friendly service from check-in staff thru to housekeeping.- In-hotel restaurant offers both local & western fare (e.g. nasi padang, burgers, etc). Quality as good as any general restaurant i've eaten in.*** The Bad ***- You shower inside a bathtub so be careful getting in/out. Bathtubs are so passe & unhygienic that they should be banned in hotels. A shower enclosure/cubicle is safer & more convenient getting into/out-of plus so much easier to maintain.- Windows can't be opened to let in fresh air (though you'd think twice about it in downtown Jakarta). - Necessity for baggage checks going into the hotel. Once at main street entrance & again at hotel lobby entrance with metal detector/x-ray just like in the airports. I do however understand & appreciate the hotel management's safety-first focus in this age of stupid cowardly terrorists who have nothing better else to do. Inconvenience is a minor price to pay for safety.*** The Ugly ***- People who still smoke in the corridor despite it being a non-smoking floor.*** Visited Notables ***- Social House : great spicy tuna roll, thin-crust pizza and burger; 1F Grand Indonesia East Mall.- Kitchenette : superb southern-fried chicken steak, cheese-nacho plate and deep-battered onion pieces; 2F Plaza Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a great experience at the pullman recently. Although my booking was somewhat bungled up by reservations, the duty manager MR Dodi and MR SOOFYAN , both went out of their way to make it up to us and we even scored a free upgrade. Great service, Geat location, great breakfast, Geat value.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really liked the location of this hotel because it is close to the shopping center, Bunderan hotel indonesi and the employees were very friendly especially mrs rahmi gratitude for its support so that became my new year and family be very memorable
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location was great, first class shooping center, first class restaurants around.Cleanes room good but needs more improvement, some was broken like the main door add lock was broken, the curtain in the bathroom was not functioning well, Complete TV channel but signal not to good, kind and friendly staff."Average" for 5 start hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My only choice for travelling for business to Jakarta, Pullman Jakarta is the typical hotel for business travellers and that's a good thing. Rooms were comfortable albeit a tad tiny. But I must say the highlight of my stay here is the breakfast buffet. Not only for their immense variety but also for the quality of food. Located in the heart of Jakarta, shopping and food is a stone's throw away. Across the road is Plaza Indonesia which is a great plus.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Clean, complete breakfast and executive lounge, good interior, good location near grand indonesia, plaza indonesia and monas. Swimming pool has warm water at night with beautiful view, slow music and great ambience 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 4 group meetings held in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia.The set-up is neat. What makes it difference is they way Pullman Jakarta Indonesia handled our requests. I have asked to have different themes of each coffee break we have, and different room setting at the end of the meeting.The banquet team is able to execute our requests efficiently and beautifully.The Sana Sini Restaurant for lunch buffett provide another pleasures for our appetite and eyes. Foods are delicious. Thank you Banquet Team Pullman Jakarta Indoensia. You are awesome.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a couple of high profile meetings in downtown Jakarta.This hotel provides the perfect surrounding in the executive lounge to host in proper stylish way.Breakfast is one of the best in Jakarta and across the archipelago.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is very good regarding all services ! I like to mention here the room sevice.. me lost a note of $100 somehow in the room ! the Room Attendant "Dian" found and returned to me after came back to room !! so impressed with her honesty and services . And I must to thank all other hotel staffs for their smily faces... so I am gladly recommend this hotel for any type of guests any time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel located in south Jakarta... Rated very good by us family... Since the group consists of 25 people...Rooms are clean and modern. Very luxurious ammenities and complete.. Breakfast are aplenty with various flavors frm sushi, chinese,english and asian taste...And its easy to go shopping since The Plaza Indonesia which is alsi connnected to Grand Hyatt is just across the riad and is link with an overhead bridge for pedestrians...Its was a memorable holiday fir the kids..they enjoyed the pool and the mommys enjoyed a trip to papmper them sekves with spa...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Being an Accor Platinum+ i often give Pullmans a go. Pullman Jakarta is great. The room was quite spacious and modern. The Staff are very helpful and efficient. The location is great... Plaza Indonesia is just across the road. No complaints....very solid hotel :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A total recomended 5 stars hotel to stay whenever u r in jakarta. A 5 stars hotel that feel 5 stars. Facilities are complete including whirlpool spa in gym area. Staffs are very friendly and showing great hospitality. Room are nice and comfortable. The pillow menu is the highlight. So far so good.Love it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is classy in all the way. The furnishings are very modern, quiet and a fantastic view of the plaza Indonesia from the window. Food & restaurant is also amazing. Hospitality is not so great in rooms but in restaurants, its amazing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location : shopping, restaurants, business.4 buffets plus the menu for each meal : cuisines from Indonesia, Japan, China, France.Good quality of the Fitness Center and the swimming pool.The choice of bottles of wine was diverse, even if alcool can be very expansive Indonesia.Delicious 'patisserie à la française'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good clean rooms although they are somewhat small, unless you opt for the executive wing. Great location if your meetings are around central Jakarta. Staff is courteous and professional.Good breakfast buffet although service can be a bit slow. It took me three tries before I was served my coffee. I asked a waiter for coffee and he replied 'yes Pak', he disappeared and never returned. I asked another waiter who said the same thing and did the same disappearing act. The third waiter finally brought my coffee. One needs perseverance and patience at breakfast in Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good property.Special thanks to Mr. Roy(Duty Manager) and the friendly staff for making my stay comfortable. Breakfast was marvelous with so many choices Luxury ambience. Close to shopping Mall's. Value for money
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great service from the beginning, friendly staffs, and most importantly understood me as customer and very accommodative. I wrote my preference for a reason, so the hotels would accommodate it the best they could. I understand sometimes they couldn't do it for one or more reason and that's OK as long as they communicate it. Pullman Thamrin Jakarta staff who handled my check-in had a GREAT job not only in communication but also very accommodative. Room was fantastic, at the end of the corridor, private, spacious, great view, nice floor height (level 9 room 951), clean, comfortable bed, great lighting (not too dim and not too bright for bedroom), nice blackout curtain that helped me sleep so well without light distraction, very good sound proof from outside, nice and clean bathroom and design, room amenities including great premium tea selection and the coffee machine (that looked like Nespresso; because even other 5-star hotels around it that claim to be more luxurious only provided coffee sachets), CO-Bigelow amenities (other hotels only provided non-branded shower amenities), and many more. Another one that put me in awe was the wi-fi because it was so easy to connect, so stable, and so fast (most hotels were either provides you the lowest speed because it's free and/or you need to connect and reconnect every single time because of time limit or instability and/or your wifi cannot take you anywhere because of firewall). Breakfast food was great in terms of choices and quality. Room service food was also amazing. Gym, pool, sauna, steam, were sufficient for 5-star, and I loved the jacuzzi because not all 5-star hotels provide this anymore. Location of the hotel was very strategic as well. I considered myself found my new favourite hotel, and as a LeClub Accor Hotels member, I am extremely satisfied.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is now my regular place of stay in Jakarta. Good location, good facilities (gym and pool in particular are both great), good service and rooms are really nice.There are nearby shopping centres and it is close to the business district. Just be careful taxi drivers don't get mixed up with the other Pullman in Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fabulous welcome with friendly staff and good Customer service. We upgraded from a superior room to a grand deluxe. The currency is very good. The breakfast spread is vast with eastern and western options. There is a map for the variety of options. I got lost lol! The rooms are a great size and the bathrooms comfortable. Pullman is always good. In Indonesia the hospitality is fantastic.....there is a good size gymnasium and pool as well as a spa. Money can be exchanged at the hotel for a good rate. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Checked in for the weekend and I can't complain much. Fast Check in. Check. Beautiful spacious room. CheckPretty room amenities. Check. Great location. Check. Wonderfully warm staffs. Check. There's really nothing the complain from checking in (and yes, I'm still around)You definitely need to book their executive rooms, cause there's open bar (daily 6-8pm) and they serve lobster also caviar for breakfast. HahahaIt just can't get any better than that. I have to say I'm coming back soon for their services. Special shootout to bartendress at backroom lounge (making you awesome mojito!), the managers ms. Oliva and mr. Martinus for the wonderful attention, and zemmy from the executive lounge for the excellent service. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent location. Room was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was great! However, my Superior Room was in no way superior (superior to what I wonder??). The room was very small, bathroom tiny, and the air conditioning was weak and unable to cool the room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice rooms with good service. The construction going on outside of the hotel spoils the view and appears to put up a barrier between the hotel and the shopping complex across the road. Refurbished after rebranding from Niko to Pullman the hotel still appears to be a little dated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for the second time since last year, i can only say that things are even better this time. Elegant, stylish, and smart atmosphere all over. All kind of food varieties and outlets available serving excellent dishes with service. Not far from shopping districts, walking distance using the bridge across the main road. Room are spacey and modern, i stayed in the Executive wing. Clean, neat and excellent Housekeeping.Nice executive lounge service snacks and drinks.A special note for the Back Room lounge, superb service, nice tapas menus. Special thanks to Miss Nina for all the special attentions and service. All the team was great as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So far, the best hotel I have experienced in Jakarta. The facilities are great and I am impressed with the staff services.The staffs recognize me throughout my stay and greet me (by name) everytime.Special mention to Wulan (from Guest Relation) as she assisted me the moment I arrived at the hotel. And she also made some arrangement for my birthday (good surprise with the song and cake).Overall, I am very pleased with my stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located at CBD, good breakfast variety. Security scanning at hotel entrance. Due to the CBD area the traffic here is quite heavy. Hotel staff will help to get silverbird limo with immediate availability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent luxury hotel next in central Jakarta (next to the HI roundabout with a couple of high-end shopping malls and eateries a 5-10 mins walk away). Comfortable rooms with all the amenities you'd expect from a 5 star hotel, including a very well-equipped gym. Concierge manager was very helpful, and particular mention to Filipus who was very accomodating and accompanied me to an unused rootftop function room/bar when I requested to take an ariel cityscape photo of the H1 roundabout.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice positioned hotel. Service is pretty good and helpful! Gym is very advanced and got somePretty coolEquipment! Got pretty good deal thru agoda web site. Breakfast is rather modest for this kind of propertyOverall recommended for business Travelers! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice quality hotel with very professional staff. Duty Manager was excellent, went way above the call of duty to help us out.Rooms excellent, very clean, modern, comfortable. Location is pretty good with a reasonably good selection of bars and restaurants all within walking distance. Nothing particularly bad about the hotel but pretty expensive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Loved everything about the hotel. The service top notch with big rooms and the buffet is humoungous with options galore. the staff were incredibly helpful and always smiling and nothing was too much for them.Would highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the main road of Sudirman Street, in front of big malls such as Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Very strategic place, but need to estimate the travel time in and out the hotel as Bundaran Hotel Indonesia always crowded! (Especially in the demonstration time, duh!)..I took the grand deluxe room, it was very spacious, complete amenities (coffee maker, tea infusion glass, etc), fast connection of Wifi, and quiet room even it's on low floor and windows headed to main road. I love the lights at the bathroom, good for morning make up rituals (Ha!).The decorations are modern in all places of the hotels. Various cafe/resto too. The Nusantara plater at Le Chocolate cafe was nice and value for money.The pool area is not too appealing, the sun is covered by other buildings so no sunbathing for me on this trip. They have sauna and steam rooms at Gym area, very nice! May come back again if my meetings sites around this hotel! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The experience when stay in here (comfortable and clean), when dining (the food taste good, with nice service), I also like the view (city view) and in the center of Jakarta, quite near the shopping mall. I recommend this place for business trip
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel was incredible the staff, reception, room service every one was helpful and smiling all the tim even the room i like it.I recommend this hotel very much not because i was in it but truly was good .ThanksRayyan Z
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed 4 nights with access to the club lounge. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Jakarta with access to Grand- and Plaza Indonesia. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were good and clean. Breakfast buffet large with a huge selection, which should satisfy most of us.The club lounge was one of the best one I have been at, though a bit of a walk from the lobby it is spacious, and really relaxing. It offers for breakfast as well as for the evening snack a well above average experience. Staff also goes beyond average to make you feel at home.For someone that does business in the city center close to the location of the Pullman Thamrin the hotel is an excellent choice
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location of the hotel is central and near to 2 of the largest malls are across the street. the strength of this hotel is the staff who provided the best service (be it during breakfast, front desk staff or lobby staff). Advise to book your cabs in advance to anticipate the traffic as only silverbird taxis are on standby at the hotel. (Silverbird are expensive compared to Bluebird or Uber or Grab).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for a week, and immediately noticed the 5 star service provided by the staff the moment you step into the lobby. Check in was a breeze, the rooms were functional (although smaller than I expected), restaurants absolutely delicious, gym and spa were great.Highly recommended for anyone else stay here, plus the location is excellent next to two big shopping malls. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Have stayed here a couple of times but first time booking the grand deluxe room which is larger than their standard rooms. Personally feel the standard rooms to be quite crammed, so this is a welcome relief. Room was perfect and clean, breakfast at lounge impeccable, and the service top notch. Kudos on the good work, felt that their service levels improved compared to a year plus ago.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

New facilities, with incredible service! Mr. Sofyan was amazing at check-in, very friendly, professional and accommodating. Five star customer service. I had a few requests and he did everything he could to make sure I was happy and comfortable during my stay. Looking forward to staying here again on my next work trip. Makes it feel like a home away from home!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have seen how this hotel has been totally re-furbished over the past 5 years, the final part for me being the new executive lounge experience. This hotel has excellent staff who have always made me feel at home in this sometimes difficult environment - they have also gone through the renovations with humour and great service. This is one of my favourite hotels worldwide and should be the level for all hotels to try and reach. Location, quality, professionalism - the best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located, very clean and modern hotel, close to plaza Indonesia. Everything was fine: service, courtesy, pool... but the most amazing think is the breakfast! A worldwide coulinary tour across different regions: europe Indonesian Chinese Japanese ... amazing ! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. Hotel facilities like gym and swimming pool are great. Really enjoyed my stay at this fantastic hotel. Good business hotel were you can relax properly. Superb 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good location, near to two shopping malls. Comfortable rooms, very good service. Restaurante is expensive if you take the buffet.If you want buy souvenirs from Indonesia, just 750m (10min walk) from hotel, go to the top floor of Sarinah Thanrim Plaza, and you will find thousand options.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I only have wonderful words to say about this hotel. The people are warm and welcoming. Safa, Sogeng and all the staff at breakfast offer excellent service and great food options. There is even gluten free cereal and bread at breakfast. The hotel is very well located next to malls and restaurants and the room was very clean.I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to come back. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

they have a very great access! very good breakfast... very good hotel atmosphere... very nice staff...But the room i think it's a little bit to small...The Shower ceiling is too low... but they have a very nice pillow option for the guest
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was amazed by the service especially by Ms. Sari. She decorated our room so beautiful, she put flowers, rose petals, rose bouquet and many roses inside our room, while placed it into the places we never expected before. Thanks for all preparation you've made for us. We really enjoy our stay, even we cancelled the plan to having dinner at Sana Sini and having special dinner inside our room because my wife is not well enough during that special nights. Thank you and looking forward for our next special occasion at yours.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This place makes you feel welcome as soon as you arrive. The staff will address you by name. The staff will pay special attention to you and your needs. They treat you as family and not just a guest. The service is quick and professional.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just last weekend after the great demo in Jakarta, me and my best friend decided to take a little weekend getaway just to refresh our body, mind and soul. I remember that once before I was referred to this place by a friend of mine. I was thinking, why not? The place is very strategic and not far from my place. So we went here on early Saturday evening to have swimming session after heavy meals we had few hours before. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the friendly staffs. One of them named Ms. Henny was very helpful and attentive. She proceeded our check-in without hassle.Located on the second floor, Pullman Jakarta Indonesia's swimming pool is on the outside area, surrounded by buildings nearby. I was hoping to see the sunset thought, but nevertheless, the evening view by the pool was pretty stunning.We love the big yet beautiful edge-less swimming pool. I'm not a swimming type of person actually, my bestie is. So just after my two or three laps, I was just enjoying the evening pool view that looks pretty with lights, sit back & relax on the sun deck chair.Too bad that the pool bar was already closed at 7 pm that I haven't tried the mocktail on the menu yet. So we just decided to go back to the locker room where we tried the steam & sauna facility along with the Jacuzzi and also the Ice Bath pool next to the Jacuzzi. They even provide two big jars of water infused with lemon and cucumber that we can conveniently serve ourselves.We really enjoyed our ladies night pamper here. Very relaxing and refreshing. Definitely worth the price and worth to come back for, hopefully any day soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 4 nights in NOV2016.Housekeeping does the job right. Also staff are very friendly too. I was happy with amount of water bottles hotel provided. It does get thirsty often in Jakarta.Great bed and perfect curtain to block all lights. It means good sleep. Also this was first hotel that I can choose a pillow from various types.Hotel has a good gym and spa. Breakfast buffet is awesome. There are just more than enough options. I liked typically the dimsums and egg dish in Chinese corner.In vincinity there is a big mall. There are so many shops and restaurants to go. I had Indonesian German Chinese food which were all good and comparably economical. Certain floors are designated for smoking rooms.I hoped there was a tissue box in the room. I did not use the swimming pool; take your swimsuits!Elevators are run by you swiping the magnetic key card. Somehow I can not do it right on first time. I saw some 3rd floor people missing their floor due to swiping failure.Overall, I have zero problem going back to this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, the hotel is great and the best value to stay here.The location of the hotel is very convenient and the breakfast always yummy, the pool, gym and spa everything is just so good! I choose this Hotel every times i visit Jakarta and never fail me at all! Highly recommended!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is right at the city centre. 2 great shopping complexes Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia is just right opposite the premise.Room is modern and neat but a bit small in size.The Sana Sini cafe only serves buffet lunch on weekend, no ala carte! However they offer the guests an 'option' to dine at the lounge where you have to bow to eat coz the coffee table is way to low!Breakfast at Sana Sini is impressive. Wide varieties of western, Chinese, japanese and local selection. Special recognition goes to Kurniawan who is very friendly, helpful and always serves with a genuine smile.

Thanks for being great guys. Will surely come back for our next trip to Jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay in this hotel whenever I need to be in central Jakarta for business meetings. I have tried other international chains nearby before, and I think that Pullman offers best in class service for a reasonable price compared to many overpriced brands.Staff is very attentive and friendly. Rooms are well designed, clean and beds are very comfortable. Buffet (breakfast or dinner) has tons of choices and fresh food. If you still want more choice you can walk to the mall accross the road.Gym and swimming pool are spacious.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was traveling to Jakarta with my thirteen year old daughter for the first time. We were there in October for her to film a movie. The production company set us up there and I was a little nervous. My fears quickly went away when i arrived. The staff was so accommodating and extremely friendly. This is such a beautiful, clean and beautiful decorated hotel. My daughter loved the bath room with the huge tub and glass windows. Our room overlooked the pool and we were lucky enough to have nice "pool" weather. Our first trip to the breakfast/brunch was incredible. There was so much food from every nationality. Needless to say we left the restaurant stuffed. I highly recommend this hotel. It's a great location and has two malls within walking distance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel in a great location. Friendly staff and hotel has all the amenities you need. Gym, pool, breakfast etc. rooms were well fitted out and of a generous size. Highly recommended. Would stay here again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is perfectly located with one of the biggest malls in the city next door. Rooms are cosier and well equipped. Hotel has its own spa at affordable rates. Breakfast is good. Few good Indian restaurants are located on a walking distance from this hotel. Staff is very courteous and service is very good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent service and facilities, well located, very friendly staff and fantastic service, deluxe rooms and above, very comfortable and spacious - like coffee pods and very good work area (worth extra); especially like opening windows, lovely breakfasts with full range of Asian (and Western) cuisines, evening meals at restaurants varied and delicious - typical first rate Indonesian hospitality!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Walking distance to shopping mall, easy foods hunting..classy atmosphere,modern industrial design. Safety is the first priority. Friendly staff..tidy and neat, smiley all the way. Near to amenities, happening night life..everything under the same roof..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room was clean, Food was nice, Location are convenient, and price are reasonable.My only complaint is the gate of the hotel. It was 12/1 am, friends trying to drop me off to the hotel but the side gate was closed. The front gate was only for exit. So where can I access then? Had to walk to the front gate from the side gate.From another point, the security is good, so no one are able to access. But for us who actually had to walk since we do not know where are the "supposed gate" for car to drop off, it is pretty dangerous.If there are a gate that still open, providing a sign pointing to the gate will be much Appreciated. or don't return to hotel late.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Best place to stay at for both business and leisure trip. Great breakfast choices esp. for Indonesian cuisines.Pak Taufik and Pak Rizki and Ibu Ety are great (breakfast staffs) Great dessert choices esp. "home made" soy yogurt (with mango topping), smoothie,
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin is located in the central of Jakarta and due to the location, you cannot avoid the traffic. Mostly biz people will stay in Thamrin are and Pullman rate is the cheapest from the other Thamrin hotels. Room is average, nice bath-up , breakfast is pretty good also but all halal.. hence you can only see beef bacon?? (seriously?).They have Indonesian style, Western, English, India and Japanese style. Overall i enjoyed my 3 days...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Small room, nice small bathtub, good noise blocking, comfortable pillows with pillow menu, high price, long queue and wait for check-in and check-out, nice breakfast options. The room is not worth the price. Other luxury hotels around provide a better service and room for a lower price.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't get me wrong - the breakfast was a good spread, just as most people have exclaimed and probably the deciding factor for me in choosing this hotel just to see what the fuss about breakfast was. If you're not into having an international dinner-type spread for breakfast, then don't pick this hotel for the breakfast. I was blown away by the variety at breakfast but many of the foods were not my first choice for breakfast.Anyway, enough about breakfast. I wanted to get that out of the way. Let's talk about the room and the staff.We had a great experience at check-in with a very cheery front desk manager when we arrived a little after 11pm. Room was pretty clean, bathroom could use an update but nothing major at all. If you're one of those who need a removable shower head, this has got it, complete with a nice bathtub that seems clean (many other bathtubs will have me cringe). Did I mention the bathroom has in-built speakers hooked up to the TV?? I suppose you can watch TV through the full height glass panels while sitting in the tub. The bed was a little soft for my liking that seems to sink in the middle but I still had a good sleep. The different variety of pillows was impressive, as was their daily 4 bottles of water for 2 of us. Small details that don't go unnoticed!Close walking proximity to Grand Indonesia Mall that was very welcomed for our short stay in Jakarta. It was a good stay overall, though I would try a different hotel if I'm ever back in Jakarta, just for variety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

People who like to shop would prefer to stay in this hotel. Its located across plaza indonesia and grand indonesia shopping centre. the clothing giant thamrin city is also in a walking distance. the hotel is very well maintained. was refurbished a couple of years ago. the breakfast is excellent!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrived at the hotel with my colleague who is visiting Indonesia for the first time.He was impressed with the overall service in Pullman with its hassle free check-in, great rooms, great bed and large breakfast buffet.Only feedback was the gym as I was at the gym at about 6am and had to turn the lights on myself and was pretty dark.Other than that, we were happy with the hotel and will definitely be back again
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Im an accor member and i love staying in their partner hotels. This Pullman really exceeded my expectation. FO team was so welcoming and really accomodating. One of the FO's i talked to was Sarah. It was my 2nd time in Jakarta and she was very helpful on my queries during my Stay. Thanks Sarah!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Best of the three Pullman hotels ive visited so far. Quick and professional checkin, great and spacious room with nice little loveseat by the window. Too bad i only stayed for one night, but budget and time didnt allow for more nights this time. Walked around the surrounding malls and streets, but ended up in the restaurant on ground floor. Sure was a happy choice for me, Beef Teriyaki was excellent and so was service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are traveling on business, this is the place to stay! Make sure this location is the one as there are two. The location, as with all, can be deadlocked in traffic. However, this location is great for walking. There is a large mall across the street - great for getting a fine dining meal or some basic fare. Nice workout facility and outdoor pool. The pool has an outdoor bar as well and is great as a central location for socializing. The staff, as with the majority of the Pullman properties, is very accommodating and will make your stay very pleasant. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great place, amazing ambiance, nice staff and warmth welcome. This is my first visit to Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. I had an amazing experience. The food was great, with lots of variety from different country. Recommended...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

April 2015, decided to use my sister accor adv plus to stay here. It was her birthday at that time, and the hotel kindly set a surprise cake at our room when we arrived back. She was feels touched and glad to receive those kind of attention. If you attracted to Car Free day event, this place are recommended to see the crowd from your own room. Facilities and ambience are good. Strategic place if you had meeting right in the center of the city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having booked this hotel for the last few years for my guests, it was good that I could finally stay here and experience it for myself and I was definitely not disappointed. The room was very well-appointed with the business traveler in mind as there was a good office chair and writing desk, a nice sofa, comfortable bed, ironing board, bathrobes and cotton housecoats (something like a yukata but in Indonesian print), a good range of toiletries and essentials, a safe, a mini fridge and coffee/tea making facility. My colleague was so impressed when she called housekeeping first to ask if they had a pair of scissors she could borrow and then later for a HTC handphone charger (which is not a common brand) but which they managed to find so thumbs up here for service. The breakfast buffet is rather extensive with Asian (including Japanese) and Western selections on 2 sections of the large restaurant area. We have to go through security checks whenever we enter the road leading to the hotel and to the hotel itself. The same applies for the shopping centre across the street (The Plaza). Also for security reasons, a restaurant staff will call you when your room service order is at your door so that you know who is ringing your doorbell. Even though there are more up-market hotels in the area, I feel that the Pullman should meet all the needs of any business (and tourist) traveler. As mentioned before, The Plaza shopping centre, conveniently located across the road, has a number of famous fashion brand shops, restaurants and a supermarket. You can enjoy great night views of the city from Altitude The Plaza on the 46th storey. I had the privilege of having a wonderful dinner with my colleagues at GAIA, the North Italian restaurant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Thamrin is a great place to stay if you want to be near the city center and nearby shopping, as it is directly across the road from Plaza Indonesia. The hotel is quite large with many facilities and would be convenient for both business travelers and families. While the building looks older from the outside, the interior has been updated in a modern décor. While a few other reviewers found the rooms on the small side, the room which I booked was fine, and the bathroom was also spacious and very well-appointed. The one problem I did have was with the hot water, as during the evening I did not have any, but in the morning it was fine. Many luxury hotels in SE Asia have lavish breakfast buffet spreads, but the Pullman takes it to another level in terms of both the offerings and quality and exceeded expectations. The Back Room Bar also had some of the best classic cocktails in Jakarta, including a very good Vieux Carre; unfortunately, our order for fresh spring rolls took 45 minutes, which is way too long. So overall, even though I had a few issues with my stay, I would definitely stay at the Pullman again, given the overall experience and location and excellent service from the staff. I really do hope they sort out some of the operational issues though to make the experience even better.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am impressed with the warm welcome and friendly staff at the hotel. I have been acknowledged as the Le Club Accor Gold member with free welcome drink voucher and free room upgrades. Check in process was smooth and hassle free.The room is comfortable and bright with great amenities kit. The bed is comfortable and I had quality sleep during my 4 nights stay at Pullman Jakarta. Breakfast at the Sana Sini restaurant was marvelous with great selections and choices. However, the restaurant staff was not so friendly and they can be quite rude. On my final day of the stay, I have brought my friend together with me for breakfast. The restaurant staff that attended us was rude and unprofessional. She kept insisting that my room is only eligible for 1 person for breakfast and that I need to pay an extra charges for bringing a friend together with me. I told her it was alright but she kept repeating that same statement to me and my friends. Upon being seated with a table of two, 10 minutes later while I was having my breakfast and chatting with my friend, I have been approached by the restaurant staff with an invoice insisting me to write down my name, room number and sign on the invoice. I was wondering what is the rush with this as I am still having my food and not leaving anytime soon. I am quite disappointed with the services and treatment as if I am going to run away without paying for the extra. I am frustrated and disappointed with the restaurant staff on treating the hotel guess and Le Club Accor member in this manner.Overall stay at the hotel was a good one. Generally, the hotel front desk staff and housekeeping was friendly and warm except for the restaurant staff at Sana Sini. I would consider staying back at the hotel for my next trip in Jakarta and hope to see some improvement with the staff attitude at the Sana Sini restaurant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my first time in Jakarta and though I almost changed to better known hotels in the same area (Pullman is neighboured by Mandarin, grand hyatt and kempinski), I am happy not to have moved. Pullman is the more quieter hotel in this area but is next door to the big malls, if one fancies that. In my opinion, best to offer out of all the hotels in the vicinity if you are there for work. Very nice rooms with all amenities one can think of. Very good service and staff always available to listen to all needs. Fantastic buffet both at breakfast and lunch with a massive food offer and all delicious. Though the layout is at times tough to scale due to the huge variety. All in all a good experience and a nice low profile luxury option in the city. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman hotel is very good. Nice large rooms with good beds.As Platinum member I got access to executive lounge which is nice for breakfast and afternoon drinks. Location of the hotel opposite of Plaza Indonesia is good.Will stay here again next time in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

as a 5star hotel, in the heart of jakarta..worth to try its best dishes. i've tried many time for the buffet, and they did it with high quality consistency. very recommended to try their rib, ice cream, and japanesse dishes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, service by the staff was excellent. No doubt that the security was tighter compared to others, I felt safe staying in this hotel. The front staff and kitchen spoke excellent English. Checking in and out of the hotel was a breeze.I was given a corner room and sadly, it was a little small compared to my other companions who got the same room type as me. (Theirs even had a sofa in it and mine none!) Room was clean, and came with an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe. Toilet amenities was great, though mine felt cramped. You have to stand to close the door before sitting on the toilet bowl. Housekeeping will replenish the bottled water daily which was wonderful - 4 bottles a day! That's really great.Wifi signal was superb though sometimes I have to reconnect but stable most of the time and the speed was decent.I used the fitness centre - Gym was ok, with very friendly staff. Spacious and decent equipment. Jacuzzi was ok as well - cold and hot. The latter was a little too hot for me though - my skin felt slightly burnt just after 15mins soaking. Did not try spa treatments as it was expensive.Breakfast was wonderful. The kitchen offered international buffet style (including Japanese sushi). Very spacious dining area which allowed me to find a seat easily throughout my stay. The whole restaurant is huge.Overall, I stayed for 6 nights and it was really wonderful. The hotel is located at a very strategic place, with the Grand Indo and Plaza Indo nearby. These two malls are pretty upmarket though.I will certainly stay in this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice, central location, I had my fair share of girevances with their service at the start but response from GM, Alexander Poindl, was swift and professional. The staff are generally friendly and warm. Swanky decor and a good breakfast spread! Will never forget the Sana Sini house special bread - Pain du Sud.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The rooms in this hotel is quite small, reminding me of rooms I have stayed in Tokyo, though slightly bigger. But this is to be expected since Pullman is in a great location and offer the best value.Breakfast spread is one of the best, together with Satoo in Shangri La
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been to Jakarta many times but the first for the Pullman, rooms are small but modern and clean, staff are just fantastic very helpful and alwaysb friendly. One of the best breakfast I have ever had.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first time in Jakarta. I chose the hotel because of the location and it's proximity to Grand Indonesia Shopping Mall and MONAS. But I didn't had any clue other than what I saw on google map. The highlight was how they treat people. Pleasant, helpful etc. etc. The doorman, reception, room service, concierge everywhere. Official check in time of the hotel is 2 PM and I went their at 10 AM. Without any hesitation they accommodated me for the early check in without any fees. This courtesy makes me comeback here when I visit next time. This is something all the tourist hotels should learn. It's a simple psychology but completely changes the impression on the hotel.Room was good. As usual I feel higher the better. Superb location. Within a day I went to Grand Indonesia Mall 3 times. Easy crossing. Ultra modern surrounding with lots of high rises suitable for some clicks. Once the MRT construction is done would be much better. Food was good. A huge selection was available for the breakfast.I only have positive things to say. Please keep the great smiles and the great hospitality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My favourite Pullman, great unbeaten service, food, and room (grand deluxe is my preferrence, it is great for bad sleepers, there is no noise at all, I havent experienced anything similar in other hotels :-) , standard room might be found great, but it is a bit small and if there is a baby or football fan in the neighbouring room it is different from the grand deluxe) This time Rudi at the give so kind service, that I remembered his name :-)! I can just say, this was a perfect stay again there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is the most expensive area of jakarta. Pullman thamrin is the best value hotel sorrounding bundaran HI. The down side is you need to cross the road through pedestrian bridge to access the shopping mall.If you need space, book grand deluxe room on the new tower. Superior and premium superios room a little bit tight and has very tight bathroom
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From start to end, the hotel never ceased to amaze us. It's the best location in the city in regards to malls and restaurants.Confortable and spacious room, consistent attentive and caring service and by far.. we had a very high appreciation for the quality of the F&B; especially the breakfast is impressive; I have never seen such a splendid buffet before. Wifi was great and constant. Thank you Pak Alexander, we will be back! Fantastique hotel in Jakarta 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Poor service service at the restaurant for breakfast. Although I was asked for my room number and brought to the table, the table was not set up. I had to ask for my coffee again and for them to setup the table.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is ideal for those who wish to travel at the Thamrin area. Also interestingly is the Sunday morning pedestrian activities that take place as the street is closed to traffic. More importantly the hotel staff are excellent when it comes to customer service. Also smiling and greeting and offer to assist. We had the opportunity to meet our houskeeping lady, Dian, who certainly made up and cleaned the room as if it was her house - that careful and meticulous.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the place for a leisurely Sunday brunch. The selection of food in the buffet is great - Indonesian, Chinese, Sushi, Western, ... All delicious. Don't pass up the wine option. You'll want to meet Rusli the sommelier. Very pleasant guy with a nice wine selection. I spent a relaxing mid-day eating, enjoying a variety of wines, listening to live music, all while reading the weekend Journal front to back. Absolutely no rush from the staff to move along. Mix of business and family guests in the restaurant. Don't miss it if you are in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Cozy place, easy Listening music and jostled free !! friendly staff as Well, If you caught in the traffic Around Hotel Indonesia round about, the back room bar at Pullman Thamrin It would be the place i recomend. In over all am Thanking Nova for taking Good care of the order and Iwan the bartender for lovely presentation of Martini. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well i was stayed in Deluxe Room for 2 nights for wedding events. I choose Pullman because i knew that i could take pictures at the lobby without any charge. So happy that finally everything run smooth on the H day. I love the room, room was clean, spacious but the bed i think quite small (maybe it's queen size?) and the pillow was a bit not comfortable for me. Staff was great, friendly. Breakfast was good, i love japanese breakfast with sushi, miso soup, etc. and remember you are not allowed to wear hotel slipper to Sana Sini restaurant (breakfast area). just a minutes walking to Plaza Indonesia Shopping Mall. keep up the good work!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel centrally located on main street. Modern with excellent facilities. Buffet dinner in Lobby level is fantastic. A dazzling array of international and local cuisines in many styles. Buffet breakfast is also good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were here for a couple of nights and although there were a few little issues, the night duty manager Dodi did everything in his power to resolve them and gave us complimentary airport transfers. A nice touch was packing us breakfast because we had an early flight. The rooms were spacious, air con was nice and cool. The buffet breakfast was exceptional with cuisine from various countries in the far east. It was quite a banquet. All staff in the restaurant were courteous and did everything they could to help you. The security is top notch, having to xray your bags on the way in (every time) and having guards positioned at all gates. The bathtub was a godsend to help us relax after the journey we had! It is located in the Central Business District - so no tuktuks here. Across the road are a few malls that have everything you need. I would say plan for plenty of travel time because Jakarta's roads tend to resemble a car park almost all of the time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good, refurbished. Great rooms especially in East wing which are larger. Restaurant good With good buffet selection, but watch your legs with the protruding counters! Also great location for 'traffic management'!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed there twice as I was there for Business trip. I was given a free upgrade for the first time, the room was very spacious, clean along with the clear street view of Grand Indonesia. The 2nd time I visited, I stayed in the standard room. It's spacious, clean and cosy. The only downside is the sound of the closing door is a little too loud but still manageable.The hotel breakfast was excellent with lot of varieties. It actually made me woke up early during my 2nd trip so I'm able to tour around the breakfast area. The staff was super friendly and patience in guiding me where I have some issue with the connection of WiFi.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at this hotel for a wedding around the hotel area. This hotel located in the heart of Jakarta financial district. It surrounds by other fancy hotels and shopping malls,, like the mandarin oriental, hotel Indonesia, plaza Indonesia etc. Okay lets get down to business, as soon as we arrived at the lobby, they have a security check point to check our belongings, after that one of the bellboy greet us and offer a help for our luggage. We went to the front desk counter to pick up our room key, once we got our key we head to the elevator along w the hotel bellboy, the room key only works for the floor that you going to be staying, plus the gym and the lobby. Once we got to our room, we were like WOOOOW!! very spacious room w double twin bed and a view of Bundaran HI( one of the famous roundabout in Jakarta) from our window. The bathroom is pretty spacious for couple to stay in, and they also provide you w robe and kimono as complimentary. The downside of this hotel is their breakfast buffet, it cost Rp300000, pretty pricey for a hotel standard. If you want to get a quick bite, I would recommend to walk towards Sarinah to get some variety of foods. Overall, we enjoyed our 2 nights stay at this hotel, and would recommend anyone to stay at his hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Walls are thin and you can hear people talking outside the room when you are sleeping. When the other room uses the toilet flush, you hear it too.Shops and food are across the road from the hotel. Too hot walk but too near to take a cab.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the spacious and modern room. Good price for the quality too compared to the surrounding hotels. Fairly central location walking distance to malls. Love the breakfast here, great range and variety! Good restaurants around the area too. I will come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in this hotel when we just arrived in Indonesia, and just before we left the country.Location is excellent with two shopping malls just right across the street (Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia). Both also have supermarkets and restaurants/food courts, convenient if you happened to be 'stranded' in the area due to Jakarta heavily congested traffic.Room is a bit crampy, but clean and comfortable.They have a gym that opens 24 hours, great option when you are jet lag!Breakfast at the Sana-Sini Restaurant is excellent. Lots and lots of options: Indonesian breakfast (bubur ayam, nasi kuning, gudeg, kue basah), Chinese (dim sum, porridge), Japanese (sushi), Western (sausage, waffles, pancakes), fresh juices and fruits, yoghurts. And they are all delicious. One of the best in town. They also serve lunch and dinner, but we did not try.There is also the Le Chocolat which serves afternoon tea and coffee, but also lunch menu (after 15h00 when Sana-Sini restaurant stops serving lunch). They have afternoon tea menu which incl. 'free flow' of delicious cakes and other dessert.On our second stay, we arrived on my mother-in-law's birthday. I informed the hotel about this and they kindly prepared a very delicious chocolate cake and a plate of Indonesian fruits served in my mother-in-law's room. She was extremely, extremely touched.Thank you to Shelby from Front Office for preparing this.I also thanked Sofyan who welcomed us and was very helpful on our stay the second time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently waiting for a friend to meet us for lunch in the non-reserved area in the second floor. First, a security guard came up to me, trying to say that the area we are sitting is reserved. Of course, it is not, but he escalated to Mr Nasir Amirudin, who harrassingly tried to make us leave, accusing us that we have no 'legitimate business being here' (Business card picture attached).I think for a so-called 5-star hotel, this is a disgrace, invasion of privacy, and a harassment. Pullman needs to improve service by getting rid of people like these.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is superb and the facilities offer all you would need. Good quality finishing a and extremely helpful staff.It has one of the best hotel restaurants I have ever come across with plenty of options. Breakfast was superb.The reason of my stay was for business and I could not think of a better location for it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, the one thing that i hate from this hotel is just the room area. Because for the title "5 star hotel" the room area is very small (sorry but i have to say the truth).But it can be treated with the taste of SANA SINI RETAURANT! Yup yup as you know, this hotel restaurant is has been popular as a restaurant that has a lot of flavor variants from the western taste to the east taste. For the taste? Super yummy! Always forget the "diet program" when i stayed in this hotel. Haha. My happy tummy.. yeaaah. So, my conclusion for this hotel is you have to decide what is your priority. The amenities or the taste of foods? It depends on you. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Pullman (Fri-Tue) and really enjoyed the experience. Staff in the Executive Lounge were just fantastic. Our thanks to the entire team there for making our stay so pleasant. Service with a smile. The food was terrific. It was impressive. Our room was very clean and everything worked well. We explored the Menteng area. It is an interesting part of Jakarta. Pak Zemmy and Bu Fabi made the checkout very smooth.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice n neat room, friendly staffs, delicious breakfast,,Especially to Mr. Kurniawan breakfast staff, thank you for breakfast service experience you gave to us,, ❤❤It would be a pleasure to have another time to stay at Pullman Thamrin 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is located at central city, has a big mall right opposite of the hotel. Lobby has very nice smell and room is clean, staff has great smiles and quite helpful. Do aware of the crazy traffic though.. yet it is the same in Jakarta everywhere!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having frequented this auberge on many occasions I feel compelled to lavish praise! The personnel are on the whole attentive and genuinely helpful.Guest rooms are congenial and hygienic which makes for a most pleasant stay! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Chosen the hotel during my business trip on August 2016 and staying in the hotel for more than one week.First time impression the hotel are luxurios, the staff are very warm and lots of choices during breakfast. Bathtub are standard for every room and the room are quite clean.Hotel staff are very wellcome, they helped me to switch the room on the next day, because i choose to stay in smoking room. Laundry also quite fast.The hotel is famous due to its strategic location in Bundaran HI and very near to Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, also business district in Thamrin.Do not worry for your morning. This hotel can serve almost anything, from Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisene, Western cuisine, and don't forget Indonesia cuisine. All are very excelent in taste and variety. I really miss that panacotta and peach danish. You will guaranteed to get recharge every morning and make you ready to face the day.Special thanks to Pak Ageng and Mr. Alexander Poindl for their quick response. Look forward to meet with both of you in the next visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Disappointing experience at this hotel, primarily due to the standards of service. The “Superior Room” itself was small and box-like and the bathroom has no ventilation. This is not a big deal, I was visiting for work, so wasn’t after anything special. However due to the numerous poor service interactions I experienced, I don’t intend to return to this hotel or recommend this hotel.In a nutshell, I visited this hotel on a 3 day business trip - so chose a hotel that is central, with free wifi and decent reviews.1. Wifi - The free wifi in the hotel is extremely slow and inconsistent. Whilst the hotel website states free wifi access, there are actually two types of wifi access, free and paid. Paid wifi gives you access to a stronger wifi network. Given that this was a work trip, wifi was a basic necessity and on of my selection criteria when finding a hotel.2. Service / Staff training - Do not expect the staff here to speak English. The staff are smiling and will always answer with “Yes, Certainly, Ofcourse” etc, sometimes even before you have finished your question. Most of the time, they don’t understand what you’re asking for - don’t ask you to repeat or clarify - as (for cultural reasons) they want to serve and please you. 3. Restaurant - a cappuccino with soya milk at breakfast - arrives as a cappuccino with milk and a jug of soya milk on the side.4. Check-in - During the check-in process, there is no explanation of the hotel, facilities on offer, breakfast timings - restaurant location - nothing. They don’t ask you any questions relating to your stay and just check you in. Maybe I have higher expectations but I checked in late at night and the following morning, realised that I was unaware of where to go for breakfast, what hours breakfast was being served, there was no map of Jakarta in the room - to give me an understanding of my surroundings. On my last day - I used the gym and happened to ask if there was a jacuzzi. Turns out - hidden in the Women’s locker room - there is a jacuzzi, ice bath, steam room and sauna room. It would have been good to have this information upon arrival, so I could have made use of the facilities on offer.5. Concierge - As it was a work trip, I had an evening free on Saturday to explore and see some culture. I explained to the concierge (who also struggles with English) and asked for suggestions on what I should see in this time, given my limited time available. The concierge suggested of all the options, that I visit the Theme Park (Keep in mind that I wasn’t traveling with children, was visiting on a business trip and wanted to make the most of the evening to soak up some culture). All in all - I explained my experience and gave feedback to the Duty Manager. In exchange, a plate of fruit was delivered to my room as an apology. Ultimately - this problem stems from the top down. The quality of training the Managers have delivered to the regular staff is poor inadequate, and superficial. It doesn’t make sense to have a Concierge who doesn’t speak English and can understand what the customer is looking for. Staff don’t seem to understand true customer service, fail to provide a positive customer experience. I feel sorry for the regular staff - as I don’t think it is their fault - it’s a lack of strong hospitality training the staff have received, and the fact that it seemed to me that 90% of the staff are unable to communicate in English. Don’t get me wrong - I have lived and worked across South East Asia and India and am patient and understanding when speaking to people for whom English is not their first language but if I have to repeat my questions at least 3-4 times with each member of staff, to try and help them understand, it is not effective. So much so that by the end of the trip - I decided to rely on Google over the staff for any of my questions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here the second time in 3 months, and once again my experience was good. To me this is a perfect business stay hotel. It ticks all the boxes. Room size might be small for some, but ideal for me. Service is always professional and conducted with a smile. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel was recommended by our client and I'm happy to stay there. Everything was really perfect. Room, staff, breakfast, leisure activities, security level.Had to smile though, when one receptionist asked to be recommended on tripadvisor. He was nice, but did just his job, nothing exceptional.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed in Pullman in different countries. One thing I am very sure is that I can't go wrong with Pullman with their room and services. This specific hotel is located across Plaza Indonesia, just need cross the overhead bridge. As there is construction on-going and considering the traffic, it may not be convenient for family with strollers to cross the road.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

great service, employees so helpful and friendly. will make your stay unforgettable. The rooms in new rings are much more bigger and brand new renovated.The breakfast buffet is amazing and so much variety 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed in Pullman many times for work. I then stopped for 5 months and went back recently. Most remember me and it was like you never really left. It's a great welcome. Great service. Centrally located across two Malls. Perfect for leisure and business 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pleasant feel as you get into the property. Speedy and no fuss checkin, albeit small clean rooms- scores well. The breakfast spread was expansive - local, western, Japanese, Asian etc etc. - would have been great if they had more veggie stuff around. A value place to stay if one had work in central Jakarta - as you can beat the notorious traffic
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located at the lobby level, the restaurant for breakfast is featuring a sumptuous of buffet of International and Asian selections. The relaxed environment and beautiful décor feed the eyes and soul during the breakfast time
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying at Kosenda hotel but transferred to Pullman hotel on my last night of stay. Pullman hotel was located right beside two huge shopping complex where you can find lots of restaurants and shops. It is also located in an area of luxury hotels including grand hyatt, mandarin oriental and hotel kempinski. The price for this hotel was cheaper than alot of those luxury hotels in the surrounding areas. The room size was adequate but nothing fancy. I would have expected it to be a bit bigger though. They have a few bars located in the hotel that looked quite attractive but unfortunately didn't have time to try them. Overall, a pleasant stay in a centralized area. I would come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I stayed at Pullman Jakarta for our 10th wedding anniversary trip to the city between 18 and 21 August 2016. I must say we were pleasantly surprised by our choice. The hotel was superb, with the Grand Deluxe Room being exactly how it has been described – clean, stylish and spacious. The staffs were warm and friendly. Led by the Hotel Manager, Mr Jeyakumaran Velusamy, the team went out of their way to ensure our stay was a memorable one. Starting from my discussions with Ibu Hani over various calls to arrange a surprise gift for my wife upon our arrival, to Pak Filipus forking out his money to front the required payments – I am very grateful to all of them. Not forgetting Ibu Grace, Ibu Farida, Ibu Lia and Pak Hary who have penned their thoughtful wishes for us. And yes, Pak Rizwan from the IT team who helped to set up the VPN connection to enable me to access my work email. All of them deserve a big pat on the back! The breakfast buffet was just sumptuous and comprises a good spread ranging from Malay, Chinese, Japanese and Western. The fitness centre is very spacious and is equipped with the latest workout equipments. The hotel is also strategically located at the heart of Jakarta on Jalan MH Thamrin. Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, Jakarta’s upmarket malls, are just within walking distance from the hotel (c. 5-10 minutes). In case you would like to challenge yourself, you could also walk to Tanah Abang, which is just 1 km away from the hotel and in my opinion, is one of the best wholesale markets in Jakarta (relatively testing conditions though with the heat or rain, depending on the time of the year and Jakarta’s notorious traffic). Though personally, I would rather take a GrabCar which should cost c. IDR13k – 15k (c. USD1.00) on a normal traffic. In short, I give the hotel and the staffs a 6-out-of-5 rating. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to visit Jakarta. To the Pullman team, thank you again and sehingga ketemuan lagi,Kamal RossiP/s: Maaf ya jika ada nama yg disalah sebut atau yang tertinggal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I arrived on a delayed Garuda Indonesia flight from London on Saturday and asked for a quite room as I was rather exhausted. I was given a room facing a street where the window insulation is not very good. You can certainly hear all the honks but I thought I can deal with that low level noise. What I did not know was that on Sunday's from 6am the street is closed to traffic. You would think that is a good thing. Wrong! Some of the pedestrians play very loud traditional music when walking on the street in front of the hotel to collect money from other pedestrians. The windows of this hotel certainly need to be changed to have better noise insulation. I went to the front desk and also talked to the front desk manager about changing my room which they did. I have to say that customer service when someone complains is generally poor in Indonesia and it was the same at the Pullman which is a disappointment for me. No compensation other then fruits were offered (which were never delivered). In general all staff were very nice and helpful. My advice is not to accept any street facing room but instead ask for the rooms facing the garden.Another unfortunate event is that a group of us went to the hotel restaurant for the buffet dinner and the next morning we all had stomach problems. By then we were a week in Jakarta and we did not have any problems with the food we ate before. I don't plan to stay at the Pullman again as I'm not happy the way they resolve problems. They are now part of the Accord group and I realized this group of which I'm a silver member has a generally poor customer service compared to more upscale hotel groups and where I will be staying next time I'm in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is very hard to describe in a few lines how extremely satisfied I was after my stay in there, the facility and especially the staff have exceeded by far all my expectations. As a Platinum Accor member, I am used to receive a special attention at all the Accor facilities, however at the Pullman Jakarta, it was beyond the standard privileges. Mr Eko from reservation made the booking, airport pick and early check-in smooth and fast while all the team at the Platinum lounge made my stay just memorable, I hope I am not forgetting anyone : Rini, Suci, Irma, Angel, Arvi, Putri, Febi, Wiji and Zemmy. thank you so much guys for your attention, kindness and the amazing improvised birthday party, thanks for the cakes and the gift. Its goes without saying that I have booked my next stay in Jakarta at the Pullman and I really advise anyone visiting Jakarta to stay in there, I wont talk about the location, the rooms, the food,,,etc, but the human experience is incomparable to any other place I have visited on a business trip. See you all in a few weeks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I always felt the home coming every time I spent in this particular establishment where most staffs such as Irma, Angel, Wiji, and other ones I can't remember the names, who always provide the first class greetings and smilings. It makes a big difference to be as Executive Lounge, Pullman Thamrin, Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay for 1 night since me and my friends had party until late night. Front office team is nice and helpful, one of them told us that we get complimentary upgrade for our room. I am not sure about that, our room is quite small and totally the same on the photos of Superior Room that published on their site.Breakfast was nice, my favorite is Chinese section. Quite odd they don't let us to put on hotel slippers to enter the restaurant.Overall we had a pleasant stay and would suggest the other traveller to considered Pullman Thamrin as one of hotel that have perfect location at Central Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff could not do enough to help you. Very modern lobby and choice for breakfast was phenomenal.Room was clean and very quiet but clear glass wall into the bathroom took a bit of getting used to (there is a blind).reiterate that drinks in the backroom are on the expensive side and dined in the restaurant one night with a great choice on the buffet but again expensive.Great location.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed here several times now, most recently in May 2016.It is perfect for a short Business trip, directly opposite 2 large malls (which makes food options easier) as walking around Jakarta is difficult and traffic is bad.The hotel staff were always very friendly and welcoming, the breakfast and in hotel food options where also really really good.More affordable then some of the other big name hotels in the area, but just as nice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Not bad. Low security, small room. Just a hotel, not impressed. Great manager on night duty, Dodi. Handled me proffesionaly & Give me nice room. But overall OK. Very suitable for business traveller, but not for a CEO.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 2N and enjoyed the closed proximity to the Grand Indonesia Mall. Staff was friendly. Buffet breakfast was very comprehensive infact too much to offer! Facilities were also good including the pool and gym. Our room was spacious with ensuite living room, toilet was huge too. What was really disappointing was the low water pressure in the shower. Despite the efforts to fix it, the water pressure remain extremely low. The time taken to shower was literally unbearable! We had to move to another hotel for the 3rd night. And felt so relieved when we finally had a chance to take a 'real' shower. And unfortunately there was also a water leak in the toilet. Would have expected the hotel to offer a room change. Something for improvement perhaps...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin Jakarta is a modern hotel conveniently located in the CBD. I appreciate modern - our suite was spacious, the bathroom exceptional, however I feel that the hotel has lost its Indonesian identity for the sake of being modern.The staff are very helpful and friendly. The quality and variety of breakfast was extraordinary.NB We were at the front of the hotel and there is currently road construction so noise filtered through.If travelling from airport in peak hour, I would suggest having prearranged pick up - no point sitting in (it took us 90 min) crawling traffic watching the metre tick over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is located strategically in central Jakarta, next to Sarinah Mall and 10 minutes walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Easy access to anywhere around Jakarta. Cost not more than Rp50,000 with taxi to Pasar Tanah Abang.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Im in my 3th year as Accor Advantage plus member and so far been delighted with most of accor hotels. Pullman is no exceptions. The room is in good size (stayed at 2 different types -Superior & grand Deluxe) both are great, i will suggest you take superior if travelling solo as its enough space for one. So far i got very clean room which is a great plus point in my opinion.And food is good. Mushroom soup with truffle oil is my fav. The pasta carbonara is good too. Only thing with this hotel is the price. Its bit pricey for your regular holiday, start from 1.5million Rupiah on a weekend (weekdays cost more)..this hotel is in centre of jakarta right infront of Bundaran HI, maybe that bump up the price. Not to mention this hotel is more known to host business traveller rather than guest to are there for leisure. If u are accor member also beware as this hotel already a non participant of accor member therefore will not give u accor advantage plus member discount, but they still give u points. Overall i give 4.5 stars, the guest relations are helpful. Also this hotel have these for free in room hire should u need it : HDMI cable,converter (for charging dock), Maternity pillow(and several other pillow options), etc.Will come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Plaza Indonesia is just across a crossing and the hotel is facing one of the city's main streets. Totally renovated, rooms are spacious and well designed, with a bathroom with large bathtub and multiple shower sets. A 4-seat dining table with a kitchenette. A L-shaped leather sofa set. Its main dining is one of the best of what I have experienced around the world by all standards. Most of all food of countless selections and taste. The best of the bests is, however, a cleaning lady named Dian for her meticulous and caring service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stay at Pullman Thamrin Jakarta for 2 nights and it was a great hospitality of the staff.. Rizki the reception are really help and gives a great service during our check in. The cleanliness is very good more than our expectation.. This is my first stay at Pullman and they treat us very well.. The location also near from the shopping centre so we don't need to take a taxi for it.. I will come back to stay here again 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have business Downtown Jakarta this is a great option, the hotel is very nice, clean, good beds and good price. There is a good bar a good coffee shop and the rest is very good buffet. Is across the street from the mall so very convenient. Staff very good. Gym also very good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are stays in this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights. We are a group of families which held a wedding reception in other places, meanwhile we are select this hotel for our place to spend the night. It is wonderful! And I thought it was just a regular 4-5 star hospitality, even so, this is one of the most recommended hotel to stay in very city center of Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Every visit to Pullman Jalan Thamrin in Jakarta is better than the previous visit. Service keeps becoming better, outlets are more lively, excellent spa, Best Buffet restaurant in Jakarta and big deluxe rooms with Specialty coffee. Hotel staff remembers your previous needs and You feel truly welcome. Staff ready to help are everywhere and security is outstanding. Executive Floor Manager Ms Rini is truly outstanding. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was our 1st time staying at Pullman Hotel Thamrin..and boy, it exceeded our expectation... the check-in staff was very helpful and friendly. the room was very spacious, we had a small living room , two single beds and a spacious bathroom to begin with. Perfect for 2 adults and 2 lil kids to running around. Our room was facing the Plaza Indonesia and the main street of Thamrin .. great view during night time :) ... We had very hearty breakfast from Sana Sini Restaurant with a delicious variety selection of food ... Truly recommendable if u r staying in this hotel. And the location was just a walk away from 2 big malls in the center of Jakarta.. We enjoyed our moonlight walk to one of the mall during one of the 2 nights we stayed in Pullman. We definitely will consider coming to stay here again next year for our Lebaran holiday . Spacious room, Great Food and Warmth Hospitality . Keep up the good work, guys :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Out of many reviews for a good hotel in Jakarta. I would say Pullman Thamrin is the best. Chosen this hotel was due to reasonable price compared to others hotel within vicinity and as well as nearby to shopping mall (Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia).Why, best stay?1. Due to last minute hotel booking, I managed to one good room for my recent honeymoon. And knows what... During my check-in, I've made a request for a honeymoon surprises from hotel. Indeed, they do their best and have done a good job for us. I would like to say 'Thank You' to the hotel staffs esp Manager, Mr Philis. It was a great effort the hotel staff has done within 15 mins. It has enlighten our stay....2. The hotel room is completed with all amenities and supplies needed for a room stay. Thumbs Up! The room is neat, clean, tidy and absolutely well stylish. This has helped us for managing our in-stay. 3. OMG! It's the breakfast time! I have discover the most tempting and sumptuous breakfast during all my hotels stay. You know what... The breakfast consists of serving English Western, Indonesia local, Japanese, Indian curry, Chinese style Dim Sum, Asian Food and etc. All food were served at different stations made available inside the coffee house. I had the most remarkable breakfast ever.4. Location, nearby to 2 Malls i.e. Grand Indonesia Mall (Biggest in City) and High end shopping mall (with supermarket). It's within walking distance from here. Hotel distance to Airport is within 40 mins (non-peak) and 60 minutes (peak). 5. Advisable to use only recommended taxi in town (SilverBird or BlueBird). 6. Good and high security check from hotel with access of in/out at all entrances. Keep it up! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located and accessible. Cozy and modern rooms with all facilities like swimming pool, fitness centre, bar etc.Food and other services are remarkable.Staffs friendly, courteous and smiling. I would definitely come back..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second time in this hotel and it won't be the last time Nice place, great hotel, excellent and very helpful employees, the rooms are big and will organized and everything else is great. A special thanks to the staff at the Exclusive Lounge for their kindness. love this Hotel 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of choices for breakfast. Located near various shopping mall both high end and medium end. Within walking distance to Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia and Thamrin. Few miles away from tanah abang.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am travelling extensively around Asia region in different hotels to have customer experiences. Every hotel have their own standard of customer service. But... I personally want to congratulate Alexander and his team for well understanding of not only high level of customer service but also a personalised services.Pullman Jakarta - Thamrin is not a 6 stars hotel but they know how to make your stay comfortable and make you feeling so special. After a long day of travel (airport, plane, car and without forgetting traffic jams in Jakarta) it is always nice to arrive in your hotel room and discover that your working desk full of sweets touched (refer to photos) with your company logo on it. So thoughtful, professional and sincere. The gesture its speaks right to the heart. I might not remember the date BUT....I will remember the MOMENTS.Thank you and looking forward to stay again at Pullman Thamrin - Jakarta on my next trip.Emmy TellierRegional Manager Southeast AsiaChristofle
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Bad traffic so i decided to walk in; the guy insisted me to open my bag for him to check and then i had to scan my bag AGAIN! Check in was just was bad; i asked for a double bed and the check in staff kept saying they are full no double bed but if i want double bed i have to pay to higher room category. She just made me feel like i am asking for an upgrade which all i asked for was a double bed. Most people i know feedback negative about this hotel but i thought it cant be that bad considering its Pullman but i guess they are right
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Travellers to Jakarta requiring convenience for meeting clients n still wanting a great place to rest, this is the hotel. The staff have a great ease of customer service and the public area are also clean and refreshing. Facilities are in line with all five star hotels and getting a taxi or hotel limousine was never a or inked for me. Security is tight in this hotel n this is good for safety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in this hotel ever since it changed from being the Nikkei Hotel several years ago. During that time it has undergone a total renovation, and is now a very nice, well presented modern hotel which is very comfortable, offers well equipped rooms, well maintained and very clean. Service levels are excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. The executive lounge is also great, has a very varied selection of quality food and beverages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay here for business and love the pool area. The staff in the bar are also very nice! i would recommend staying here as it's secure, very well located and beautifully decorated. Bar is a little pricey, but has nice vibe.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the service: friendly and helpful staff, room is clean but a bit small, great breakfast is great with so much varieties of food and cuisines. It's an ideal place to stay for short business trip also centrally located for shops and restaurants.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great friendly staff, superb room. The breakfast buffet is amazing. Western, Indonesian, Chinese cuisines are all there. The Back Room bar is fantastic, just drinks are a little pricey. Good cigars selection and comfortable seating. Smoking is allowed but it is very well ventilated. The staff was constantly asking what they could do to improve.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no words but WOW! Everything starting from the concierge to the back office support was excellent. Awesome room and amenities. Cleanliness and customer service was gr8. View from the room was splendid. Breakfast? Don't ask...all international cuisines... Wow. Location was very convenient. Big shopping malls like Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia shopping town, Tamrin city, Cikini gold center, Tanah Abang were very near to hotel...overall it was an awesome experience and looking forward to my next visit... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for your hospitality and great friendly services that made our stay memorable and enjoyable.This is our 2nd stay with u n we hope to have d chance to go back again soon.Your Guest Relations, Mr. Filipe and another GR (a lady in d night shift) were friendly n helpful. Especially when the lady called to ask if we needed the hotel nurse to look on my son's toe when she heard it was bleeding.Your pool is excellent for kids and just wish u can open up for certain public (mayb Accor members) so that we can go to the pool on the weekends just to swim.However, for d breakfast at the !'Sana Sini' restaurant was a little disappointing since I had to ask 3-4 times for a simple tissue.But in overall, we are satisfied with Pullman Thamrin. Thank you, Pullman, for a job well done!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, the service was amazing. Mr Willy on Concierge helped us secure travel to our next hotel in Bandung, he went the extra mile throughout our experience there! The rest of the staff are amazing, all so friendly and very helpful with what to do, directions etc. The rooms are spotless and the swimming pool area brilliant! Very quiet and relaxing stay, the security to get in are very polite and make you feel safe and at ease. Highly recommend!!!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman has become my #1 location for regular business trips to Jakarta. Working in this part of the world, I value a hotel where everything works, security is good but not disabling, and the food and water are reliable. The Pullman has now managed all these things for four or so visits and continues to impress.Food here is superb. The buffet breakfast has dishes from around SE Asia, Japan and western options. Some of the offerings are a bit strange, but its worth having an adventure and trying a bit of everything. The hotel also offers a separate bakery/coffee shop and a chocolate lounge. Located opposite two big malls, there are plenty of food options available outside the hotel, as well as pharmacies and department stores.While it is starting to show its age in some of the rooms, the very attentive staff are quick to fix problems or try to find a solution.If management can maintain the enthusiasm, I will continue to stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The perfect location for spending time in jakarta.. it is very close to the biggest shopping mall in jakarta which is grand jakarta, and the plaza.The staff were very helpfull , first we were very late at night and hungry we asked the concerige to order Macdonalds for us and they did .The second thing that happened to me during my stay there is that i forgot my (cartier) ring in the lobby washroom, they found it after me arriving to the airport.Sure it took cartier 3 months to ship it to kuwait, but the pullman staff did there best to try to ship it out (the problem was there is no company that could ship golden jewlery without a dicleration, so the gave it to carteir jakarta .Thank u pullman staff.The room was neat and good space.. bathroom was clean and suitable.Good place to stay.. highly recomended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

in the heart of the town and providing such a nice room with the best breakfast house ever!love everything during my stay at pullman Jakarta and soooo much looking forward to be back there again :)))
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A luxury hotel gets its stars in all details of services. Here at Pullman, you will enjoy a perfect discreet and efficient service.All the employees are generous and you feel as a super star whatever you do!!The rooms are as expected, well furnished, clean.As a frequent traveler in Asia for years now, I am proud to see a level of quality like this.When luxury seems to be just normal and not sophisticated!!A must go in JKT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My only regret was not staying more nights in Pullman. The service was exceptional, the room was spectacular (I almost didn't want to leave the room to head out), the pillows were heavenly (I really want to purchase them), and the buffet breakfast spread was extraordinary. Basically, I had the best eat-sleep-repeat in Pullman that I've never had anywhere before. Will be back real soon. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 2 nights here for business. Centrally located in Jakarta CBD area. Fast check in after my late night arrival. The rooms were pleasant with full amenities. You also have different choices of pillows to sleep on which I personally love it. Breakfast buffet with a variety of continental breakfast, Chinese style and Japanese too. Totally value for money. Overall service is top notch from the check in reception counter to restaurant for breakfast.All major shopping malls are just walking distance across the main road via the overhead bridge. Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia shopping malls all nearby. You don't need to worry about traffic jams.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed in this 5 star hotel in Central Jakarta. In the area there are plenty of hotels from 5 star to budget hotels, but I am glad to have chosen to stay here.Check in was a breeze and I truly appreciate the help of Jonathan and Rizky, very courteous and helpful. Welcome drink is spot on and nicely done. Some other hotels who do this are either too cheapskate hence drinks are lousy but Pullman's was great. The room was ready at almost 12 noon so this is a plus point already. Grand Deluxe is spanking new, i love everything about the room. It's located in the taller tower at the far end with separate elevator access so it does give a sense of privacy. The room has everything I needed for the stay. I love how digital everything is, including the PressReader app. I read so many things, newspaper like NY Times and even some magazines from Australia and US. Cool!Breakfast and room service were top notch, the spread at the restaurant is perhaps the best in the city. It seems they have a lot of promotions going on which is nice for the guests :) If i come back to stay here, i'd perhaps spend more time at the bar. What i like about the bar is how comfortable and soothing the whole place is even if there are a lot of other guests. I like the wooden ambiance there. The gym is probably one of the biggest i've seen. The pool is alright albeit the blocked view of nearby buildings.One thing for improvement is the spa prices. I understand that it's a hotel spa. But consider lowering down a bit of your price point so that the menu doesn't scare people away and choose standalone spas outside.However, everyone is so polite and is indeed the true asset of the hotel so please keep it up. I already tell colleagues to stay here if they come to Jakarta. I will come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We arrived on the first day of our honeymoon and were greeted by the lovely staff! We arrived early but they made sure our room was to the perfect standard. They let us check in about midday because they wanted to add some touches to our room for the honeymoon. Ricky on reception was very nice and helpful! The rooms are spotless and it could charge over double and still get people coming! 5 stars!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Would like to say a special thank you to all the staff at the Pullman for making our stay with you enjoyable, Jonathan thanks for arranging my wife's birthday cake and flowers it made her day even better. Room was a little small with low lighting for my wife to do her make up. The hotel itself is a little dated but the exceptional customer service from the maids right through to bell boy makes up for it. I really think other hotels worldwide need to learn how to treat their guest like the Pullman staff do. Breakfast... Well what can I say one of the best I've had so much choice it takes a while to select what to eat. It would be nice if there was some place out the front to sit. Swimming pool area wasn't anything special but the sauna and steam rooms were fantastic, they provide everything you'd need there. Gym area looked sufficient too. I would like to say that should the possibility arise please do open a small market as there isn't anything around within easy walking distance. Thanks again and keep up the fantastic customer service. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 4 nights in June 2016, and was given a room on level 7. The hotel staff are very polite and courteous, and go out of their way to make their guests feel comfortable. I would especially like to mention the house-keeping lady named DIAN, who exemplifies all these qualities. The only room for improvement I would suggest is for the early morning staff at the Sana Sini Restaurant at breakfast to improve their courteousness as well, to match the high standard maintained by the rest of the hotel staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Clean, modern, great rooms and very good buffet breakfast. Here on Business and very pleased with the choice. Jakarta has one of the worst traffic challenges in Asia, we pick based upon proximity to business meetings. Don't get this wrong or you could grow a beard sitting in traffic!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and it was impressive. Gorgeous furnishings well designed. Lovely bathroom with plenty of amenities. Staff were friendly and efficient even replacing the fridge in the room when they came to empty the minibar and realised it was not working correctly. Good fast wifi and the public areas are outstanding. Only area for improvement is the pool area which could be made more of. At the moment its a bit antiseptic and not in keeping with the very stylish nature of the rest of the hotel. Aircon for me does not quite get cool enough in the room even with maximum fan and minimum temperature. But overall a fantastic combination of style value and location.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first time in this hotel. Check-in was a breeze and they accommodated my request for a higher floor not only with a higher floor, but also with an upgrade. I was given a welcome drink at my choice of outlet till the room was ready. When I was escorted to my room my luggage was already there. Fantastic customer care. I had many meetings hence, ordered quite a lot of room service for my business partners and I and the food was consistent and great. Love the fact that the room service order taker gives one a time and the food arrives on the dot. The breakfast was fantastic. A wide array of choices for everyone with one of the biggest spreads I have seen in any hotel !I had flu on my last night and the reception arranged for the in-house nurse to come take a look at me, the very minute I called them. Check out too was a breeze and everything arranged just perfect for me to be out of the hotel in less than 15 minutes. If you like bars and clubs, there are many within walking distance. The security was great too. The rooms were very good and the amenities and cleanliness top notch. If I was looking for hotels to stay in Jakarta, I shall not look no more. The Pullman Thamarin is for me, the pick of the lot. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff of this hotel is friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. I have been offered a complimentary drink while waiting for my check in as when I arrived at the hotel , my room was not ready (although it was already after 3pm). The room is cozy, bright and comfortable. The bed is comfortable and I enjoyed my 5 nights stay with Pullman Thamrin Jakarta. Would definitely recommend and return to this hotel whenever I am in Jakarta for Business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was given an old wing room at first and the bathroom had a very bad humid smell that's like wet clothes left undried. I needed a bath desperately after a long day of meetings and thankfully I managed to change to the new wing which was SO MUCH BETTER.Breakfast is rave-worthy with the spread and the egg tarts are to-die-for. There was even lobster porridge! Set aside at least 1hr to slowly enjoy the variety of dishes available.Room service food was quite good, however I find the service subpar because shortly after I called to order a soup and ice cream, I wanted to change the ice cream to another dessert and called back 30 seconds later, only to be told it's been scooped. The dishes came to me with the ice cream half melted which was very disappointing.I used to always stay at Grand Mercure Harmoni (absolutely love their service there) for my business trips and decided to try Pullman for a change, but this stay made me truly wonder if paying twice the price is worth while just to enjoy the breakfast. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay in this hotel for 2 days.. the hotel was awesome, the lobby looks so modern and cool.Check in process just within 5 minutes and the reception was so helpful.The room is clean with simple decoration.On my first night, I have my dinner in room, the food was so nice and tasteful.I am sure that I will come back to this hotel with their "almost perfect" services.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at this hotel more than 5 times since 2015 and I am amazed at the quality of service I receive. From the airport representative to the housekeeping service is superlative, but not only the service it's also the friendliness of the staff that makes me come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first visit to Jakarta. Glad I was able to stay at the Pullman.Service was excellent from the start when I alighted from my cab, until the last moment when I picked up my luggage and boarded my airport transfer.Gym was good. Just about the right size and with fairly new equipment. I liked that there were many clean towels and ice water was made available.I definitely had very good sleep during my two nights' stay at Pullman. Room did seem a little small but I really cant complain more given the overall comfort and standard of furnishing within the room.Breakfast was excellent. The variety and quality of food was one of the best I have ever seen in my few years' of travel, be it for business or leisure. My co-workers told me that they have even went there for lunch buffets even though they do not stay at the Pullman itself. The food quality seems pretty well known.I was there on the day where the local taxi company decided to give out free rides a day after there were protests in the city centre. While I had trouble getting a taxi, I could see the bellboys trying their best so that was fine. Otherwise I almost always saw a queue of Silver Bird taxis in the lobby.Location was quite decent. At least from the perspective of it being near the gigantic Grand Indonesia mall. It was a short 5-10min walk back after I was done exploring the mall both evenings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose the Pullman because of its location, right next to Grand Indonesia and Plaza malls and in the middle of the city. Despite the excellent location, the hotel is priced about 50% lower than the similarly located Hyatt and Kempinski (and some others). I think it is still a very good deal as the location is just right- ok it is on the other side of the street but you can access everything with a 5 minute walk. The hotel is a little old, but the rooms and amenities are very good. I was upgraded to a bigger room due to the loyalty membership, which was really very nice. Staff are very pleasant and helpful, and the hotel facilities (gym, pool) are satisfactory. The buffet breakfast is mindbogglingly huge and very good quality.I would not hesitate to visit the Pullman again, however i do think there are some things they fall short on:1. the hotel is part of a larger complex that includes residences and offices. This means that accessing it is somewhat problematic, with a fairly roundabout way of getting there. Also, any car coming in must pay a fee. This can be waived if you tell the concierge the car number and he registers it, however this is cumbersome2. The club lounge is located quite far away and the selection of food and beverages in the club could be much better 3. For some reason, the hotel does not accept the Accor Dining membership card (other pullman hotels in asia do).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rooms are a notch smaller than other Jakarta hotels of similar level, but very comfortable, cozy, clean and provides everything required for an easy stay. l found the air freshner used in the hallway and room very soothing and fresh. Breakfast layout is vast and covers the popular Asian & Western cuisines with lots of choice. Service is warm and professional overall. In room dining menu is pretty good, prices are reasonable and food taste & . quality is high standard. Great location and perfect for business travellers. Highly recommend this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have shied away from this hotel for my past visits but decided to give it another try, however it a mistake I hope I won't repeat. Stupid me!!!The hotel is great actually after the recent refurbishment and the personnel too are wonderful people but are helpless with the stupid F&B policy in place.You see if you were to dine in the Sana Sini restaurant in the hotel, they WILL CHARGE YOU FOR WATER!!! Even though you will be ordering juice, coffee or a drink + a starter + a main course + a dessert later. The food is fair bit not to die for until you must GIVE IN to their demand if you ask me.Most hotel operates with focus on rooms sales are most critical part of the business but I guessed this hotel operates differently that their F&B is more important than their room sales and hotel room guests satisfaction.After all one could easily bring down their free bottles of mineral water from their room. Consumed it or just dumped them in the restaurant and request for more FOC mineral water later from the comfort of their room.What enforce a rule or policy that you cannot totally enforce and at the same time pissed of hotel room guests and cause then to not to return.So if you plan to stay in this hotel and dine in the restaurant make sure to bring you own drink or just better off staying somewhere else.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed at Pullman Thamrin CBD many times and the staffs have been able to maintain a high level of service and dedication for the comfort of its guests. Basic amenities are never insufficient and the food quality especially the break-fast spread is sumptuous and delicious.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been staying in this hotel on numerous occasions but I've realised that I've never reviewed this hotel after its renovation (if I'm not mistaken).Anyway with my repeated visits, it goes to show that this hotel is simply amazing and location is perfect for me as it's relatively close to most of my meeting places and I've never had any trouble getting a taxi regardless Blue Bird or SilverBird.This trip was a little busy so I actually ordered room service several times and I must say that the food was consistently good.The breakfast buffet was amazing as well, you can walk to any part of the restaurant and you'll find different variety of dishes. They have the LARGEST breakfast buffet spread compared to ALL the hotels I've stayed (which is quite a lot).If there's any negative feedback I can think of for this hotel will be the construction that's going on in the front of the hotel but that's not exactly within the hotels' control.I'll definitely be back again whenever I'm in Jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel; excellent situated in center of Jakarta opposite of Plaza Indonesia.Good accessible with taxi's despite the traffic in Jakarta. Spacious rooms with nice bath and good beds.Executive Lounge is also good and not crowded at all.Will stay here again next time in Jakarta 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Really good stay in the hotel, good business centre facilities and helpful staff. The outside pool was good and the rooms were to a good standard. Shops and bars in close distance. What I would give a word of caution, the hotel provides a set taxi fair to the airport. This on the meter was 200,000 whereas the fixed charge is 400,00...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I definitely stay here next time in town. Breakfast is so good, so much varieties to choose from and very good quality of food too. Room is a bit small but comfortable. Service is very good. Centrally located to shops and offices.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very conveniently located in the heart of JKT. Overall nicely done up, and the room was really nice and clean. Very comfortable too.The hotel bar on the lobby level reminded me of those old-styled English clubs - setting up a nice ambience. Overall great experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good business hotel with a great buffet restaurant. Rooms are clean and modern albeit half the size of similar rooms at the Mandarin across the street. Still a good solid choice in the center of the city. If there is not much traffic, the ride to the airport is now less than 40 minutes. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel location is pretty good.. with the kempinski on the opposite side of the road.. and a good shopping mall and .. the social house ....Good as a business hotel... !! For indians .. there is also an indian restuarent very close to it..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for a conference over four nights. Staff are welcoming and smile a lot. If this is your first visit to Jakarta- particularly post terrorism attacks- you will notice a lot of checkpoints and metal detector including right at the main door. It can be a but unnerving but you get used to it. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Food service is good but pricey. Wine cost a fortune.If you are an Accor loyal member don't expect perks. If there were any I didn't notice it. I did get a nice phone call right after check in but that is it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I would have given this hotel a five-star rating if not because of poor quality of courtesy and politeness of the staff. The only real warmness I received from the staff was from the bellboy. What really bothered us was the staff at the Sana sini restaurant (the wait staff and the kitchen staff manning the food stations), They didn't seem to enjoy offering you any service.In terms of rooms, location, and quality of food were all outstanding. But Pullman should retrain their staff in terms of hospitality if it wants to be a truly great hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose Pullman the first time and it was the perfect choice and I never chose another ever since. The staff are extremely helpful and the hotel was absolutely worth the bucks.Sana Sini restaurant is absolutely splendid and so I am very satisfied.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel service is awesome! Would like to thank Mr Filipus for his dedicated service and the reception team. Everyone has been so prompt and efficient in assisting my requests. Also would like to mention Mr Wahyu (From Le Chocolat Lounge) for his attentiveness towards my clients, the team at the Lounge cafe has been very helpful in making my business meetings a smooth and successful one. I was pleasantly surprised when I received a letter to my room, it was a kind gesture to notify me about my clients. This goes to show that the hotel management takes great care in the details of its guests. Thank you so much. I have stayed in many high end hotels but I must say the service Pullman Thamrim provided has far exceeded my expectations. It's the little things that makes all the difference and you have certainly achieved that. Will definitely come back for my business and leisure trips again. You guys have been wonderful!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just stayed for 4 nights and this hotel exceeded all my expectations from the moment I arrived. I stayed in a Grand Deluxe room which was exactly as photographed! Very spacious, clean, tastefully decorated, aircon already on, big comfortable bed, rain shower, sufficient power supply throughout the room, great work desk and fluffy bathrobes. Faultless! I had a city facing room with pretty views but unfortunately had to change rooms at 1am due to loud MRT construction outside the window. The hotel should advise guests that the construction is 24 hours. Easy walk over to Grand Mall and Plaza Indonesia. Very easy to get taxi's and the door boy / girl were extremely helpful!Sini Sana restaurant had a great buffet which I visited 3 times. Great value and wide variety of dishes (Western, Indonesian, Chinese & Japanese) stations. The service in this restaurant was outstanding. Wanted to try "The Back Room Bar" but it was filled with cigarette smoke & they offer only a tiny non smoking room. Spent a bit of time at Le Chocolat Lounge which was better!Pool was really nice and the gym fully equipped. If you're contemplating staying here just book it, you wont be disappointed!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I always love this hotel The lounge is good, their breakfast is delicousssssssss........Nice room with nice food and stuff are Yes For me.and its a good location if you like to shop, I would like to come back for sure
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying at the new wing.. everything u can from a 4-5 hotel.The buffet breakfast and lunch selection is delicious and hv lots of selectionsThe executive deluxe with excess to lounge is big and modern with good toileteriesThe pillow is greatThe staffs are friendly and accomodatingNo China tour group ppl which i like hahaha
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta Indonesia i came in Dec 2015 to attend a business event. The lobby and ballroom are presentable. The food catering is good, especially the desserts.Taxis accessible and drivers know where this is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Centrally located opposite of the grand Hyatt. Be aware there is a huge construction site in front of the hotel, so better get a room on the back site.Check in was swift and professional. The rooms have a good lay out but start to show their age (after only 4 years !!). Some of the mirrors look terrible and I suggest the change them immediately.Service is in general very good, staff very helpful. The lounge is good and the breakfast is good too.Restaurant is very descent too but I still wonder when ordering a Gado Gado I received one made exclusively from carrots.As such good hotel, I will be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I visited the Pullman to attend an event being held there. It's a pretty smart hotel. They really do cater for the events but larger event area than anything else. Breakfast buffet was vast and tasty.Conference layout was weird with limited networking space going into the main ballroom but other event spaces there was more. No gym but a giant outside swimming pool was odd.Service was pretty good all round.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the hotel for four days in early May. Although the size of the room initially disappointed me and was unexpected, the proximity to two large malls and being in Central Jakarta made things convenient. But perhaps the single most outstanding point that stood out was the genuine friendliness of the Pullman staff, all of whom were eager to make the stay as effortless as possible. In particular I would like to thank Mr. Riski, the front desk agent, and Mr. Maulana from the concierge section for their support. The staff would make you want to come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location; just across Plaza Indonesia. Staff is all smiles and friendly. Pool is clean and gym is well stuffed. Room is abit small but clean. Bed is cushy. Would like to have more sound proofing though; I can easily hear sounds from rooms and in corridor. Didn't try the food to know if it's good or not. But the restaurant is rated top 20 in TripAdvisor. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is changed from Nikko to Pullman and they provide 2 wings. The old wing is compact size turned from Nikko's japanese room size. The new wing is more luxurious. They are very clean. Breakfast is very fascinating which you may choose from local indonesian to japanese, chinese and western style. Choices of beverages are nice from espresso machine with syrup or juice or hot tea.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for two nights, and to be honest I did not arrive till nearly midnight, the recoptionist was helpful and did give me a room upgrade, The Exec Lounge is very tucked away on the 2nd floor not in the tradition of other Pullmans where its on high floor with great views, rather its tucked away on the 2nd floor where all of the conference facilites and it seems as if they do not want people to find it! The bedroom seemed small despite the upgrade, what would it been without it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has good staff let down by the food in restaurants which is pretty average, especially the western food - the club sandwich was clumsy with awful bread that became soggy. The standard rooms are rather small and boxy - Ok for one person but two would be cramped. The gym is good. Location is pretty central.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best thing about Pullman Jakarta is its location. It was really easy to walk across to PI to find food and shop. As it was only a short weekend trip, we didn't have much of an expectations. If there is 1 improvement, I wish the rooms were a little bit bigger as it was small considering its a Pullman and this is Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

a warm welcome with smiling faces from the staff made the day lighter. Pullman is at the right location easy for shopping, fun and some relaxation on the weekend. Breakfast was excellent with many choices from Chinese, Japanese, Local and Indian as well. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

good fitness centre in the middle of bustling cbd. have plenty of cardio machine and weight machines. they also have spa/sauna/steam with cold water plunge.one complained is the scale. its high tech but i think it doesn't work properly. might as well change to a better and newer ones
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a 6 days stay at the Pullman Jakarta this is my 3rd visit and the location of the hotel opposite the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia with groceries, restaurants, shops, movie houses (latest movies not even released in Hong Kong) is really fantastic The deluxe room is fantastic and spacious and although the Front desk service is a little shaky with communication issues (I had to stay 30 minutes every time to explain I need separate bills for business and personal) and the concierge desk at the reception counter saying the limousine is booked but nothing happened - maybe it's a communication issue or a training issue - a gentleman in the overnight shift is very good - Mr Rizki - he fixed the bill that 2 receptionist cannot seem to fix and even prepared the bill before I arrived at the Front Desk. The front office service might be shaky but Mr Rizki made everything great - will recommend the management to train the rest of the team how to separate folios and transfer bills Highly recommended hotel for location facilities and housekeeping / bell service quality of service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a short stay here for 4 days, very much a business hotel with friendly staffs. Sini sana restaurant serves great buffet breakfast with various choice from local, chinese, japanese and western range. We do almost daily in room meal for our dinners, food taste good though price is at the higher end. Pool is ok, security is good, bed is comfy, wifi is superb,all is good for commercial and business like, if you were there for a vacation, stay elsewhere.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like to try the new hotel, especially which part of Accor properties. This time, I stayed at Pullman Thamrin, Jakarta which has very good location, very in the heart of Jakarta. As always, my Accor membership recognized well here. The room even a bit small but clean and tidy, the bed and pillow was so comfort.Overall a good hotel but several issues can be the management attention in enhance its services which are:- Is Guest Relation Officer = Operator?? I tried to book reservation for dinner in Sana Sini restaurant through GRO hoping I can ask several assistance personally but at the point the GRO directly connecting me to the Sana Sini staff. So what is the point this hotel has GRO?- Even though this hotel recognized Le Club membership but Accor Advantage Plus membership did not recognized here so the value of this hotel (at least in my opinion) not so good in term of Loyalty Membership.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rooms are new, location is good and service is good as well. It is within walking distance to all the restaurants and shopping area. Breakfast and cocktails were great at the lounge.Although Accor platinum benefit wasn't as good here, I was not offered the next category room upgrade and only 1 person (named platinum member) is complimentary for the cocktail. (Got to pay separate for my wife to join me)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for three nights the hotel is very quite and nice. Quite near from shopping center and lot of food options nearby. Hotel staff is very friendly and i believe its value for money.Clean room, Good Breakfast, Free Internet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia for an early April business trip to Jakarta.Was pleasantly surprised when myself and two colleagues were upgraded to the apartment style room. Entering the room, I was very grateful that the AC was already operating and cooled the room to a nice, refreshing temperature. As for the room itself, it was very spacious with a cozy living/sitting-room area plus there was a good-size kitchen, dining table for four, and a two-door refrigerator (generously stocked). The king-size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a walk-in shower will full-size bathtub.We didn't have breakfast at the hotel and choose to walk a short distance to an older shopping mall/market called Sarinah which had McDonalds (McMuffins tastes the same no matter where, thank goodness!) and a basement food court which wasn't open yet.The hotel lobby had cleverly designed sofas which also acted as partitions. I didn't have the chance to use the hotel amenities, such as the pool or the exercise equipment, but before checking out the next day, my colleague showed me around as he had did some exercising and cooled off in the pool and was quite positive about his experience.Overall, was impressed with the style and service of the hotel, and would definitely book it again for future business trips.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay twice here which i find the room great looking and the breakfast is so good compare to other hotel which will cost more. you can get access to shopping mall just across the street which is link by an overhead bridge.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the location is a plus, easy access to surrounding area, room are nicely done except the shower place is kinda cramp otherwise would be a great place to stay, the lounge personally i find the food not that good...and tea are serve warm instead of hot....
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 1 night during our wedding anniversary in the apartment room type. The apartment was modern, clean, and spacious, it is divided into 2 separate rooms with an awesome bathroom. As my husband booked it for Anniversary, the hotel gave us a "Happy Anniversary" wishes written on a plate with some slices of cakes and fruits as compliments. Nice.it was an old hotel building however it had been fully renovated into a modern and chic design.For a five-star-hotel, Pullman Jakarta has it all, it's located at the heart of Jakarta city, just a step away from huge malls, city sights, restaurants and even hawker center near Thamrin area at night. It also has swimming pool and spa facility.The hotel buffet breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant was also nice, great variety of foods from appetizers to desserts, from Asian to Western, you can have all of them really nicely presented and cooked. We really enjoyed our stay in Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room on the newer wing is nicer. For some reason all hotels in the vicinity have the occasional problem of sewer smell in the restroom. Hyatt, Keraton.....and this was no exception. I must emphasize that it wasn't very strong nor it was there all the time but you could smell it sometimes. Must be the location, coz I stayed at Shangri-La, Raffles, Ritz, but didn't have this problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman is a wonderful hotel filled with a beautiful room, great restaurants, a shopping mall next door, and reasonable prices. The city is busy but in this trip there wasn't any real traffic... Not the norm.The associates were helpful at every turn and I felt very welcome...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying at Pullman Jakarta Thamryn is always great.The quality of the hotel and and facilities is amazing. The restaurants and bars are absolutely perfect.The rooms are extremely comfortable and very well designed.On the top of that, the people are always so nice and smiling, always doing the best to make your stay perfect.Congratulations to the team.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A week after my first trip to Jakarta, I decided to pack my bags and immediately fly back to this lovely city. This time, I decided to stay at Pullman Hotel in Thamrin.The location of this hotel is pretty strategic. It's within reach of everything (Monas, Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia, National Museum, Dapur Babah etc) and taxis are abundant in the area. The traffic jam though can be really bad during peak hours. But then again this is Jakarta, everywhere, the traffic is bad.The breakfast buffet has a huge and i mean HUGE selection of food. The Indonesian dishes were superb but the rest were meh.Room service and house keeping were okay but I feel that it can be improved more.Staff are really friendly, courteous and very accommodating.Will definitely stay here again when I return to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I followed my husband doing his business trip for 2 nights. So the trip is both business and leisure at the samw time. This hotel is great for its location and comfortable room and bed. While it's easy for him to hop around for his meetings, it's super convenient foe me to just cross the street and enjoy shopping and dining in Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, or check out local Thamrin City Plazza. The room was also grwat. We booked grand superior 5th fl street side. Unexpectedly, there was no noise at all despite the big construction. For me, I love streeside as I could see many buildings and the roundabout to see how the city lives as opposed the the static ok pool. Bed is very comfy and glass wall of the bathroom gives me a good rest after long ahopping day watching YV in the tub. It's a pity we booked room only and so didn't try the breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Woah wasn't expecting that much people! Full house! People in casual clothes in the pool. Actually rooms are nice except that there were just too many people. Never again on New Years eve. Booked because rated were reasonable. Service was very good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a frequent business traveler to Jakarta. I rotate between this hotel, the Le Meridien, JW Marriott, and the Ritz Carlton. I'm always perfectly happy to come to the Pullman Thamrin - the breakfast spread is the main draw for me. The room is nice and comfortable but as expected from this price point.The breakfast spread has western, Indonesian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and good selection of pastries. Comparing it to the other hotels I normally stay in, I'd say that this is the one that I enjoy the most, mostly from the sheer variety.Location is also very good for going around Jakarta CBD - the roundabout makes it very easy to go in any of the four directions from here. Another plus point is the proximity to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, just walk out of the hotel and cross the overhead bridge and you're there. I've walked that bridge several times at different times of the day and night and have always found it safe - some of the steps are a bit uneven though.Service is also excellent in this hotel, though the check-in and check-out process is a bit slow compared to the Marriott/Ritz Carlton.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my 3rd stay and always a fantastic stay. The staff are very very helpful and kind. The hotel and spa itself is great....its not a huge hotel but lots to do around it! Would always stay here when in Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very modern and comfortable hotel - loved the big bathtub in the bathroom and the huge and comfortable bed with pillows for every taste. Another highlight was the breakfast buffet, so many delicious options to choose from! Service was super friendly, all combined made for a very pleasant stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel with great staff and service!I believe it is one of the best hotel in Jakarta for location, value and cleaness. It is located in Thamlin area where it is very close to Plaza Indonesia and other restaurants and stores. The hotel is very clean and nicely managed, great restaurants and also has a smoking bar. It is good for business and family trip.On Sunday, there is a Car free day for people to walk and run on the street in right front of the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My usual haunt in Jakarta for business and leisure. Great breakfast and go for the 'Grand' rooms in the new wing if you can. Much larger and better appointed. Stop by the Back Room Bar (formerly known as ChemiXtry) for your nightcap before retiring for the night. Great location, ambience and food. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in the Executive suite Room for 1 night.I was made to feel very welcome by the doorman friendly. Checked in at executive lounge. Very courteous and knowledgeable staff there. They were polite and well-mannered, handling any problems with kindness and understanding. If im not wrong one of the lounge staff name was Miss Irma.Location very good, near to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia shopping mall.One thing that make me disappointed was that i cant have breakfast at the restaurant, i only can have breakfast at the executive lounge which has very little choice of menu.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After browsing all hotels in Jakarta for sometime, finally we have chosen this hotel: perfect location in the city centre, close to famous biggest shopping centre and other attractions.Hotel has impressive lobby with very relaxing atmosphere. Check In was quick and smooth. All staff was friendly with good positive altitude, smiling and ready to go extra mile.We have booked standard room. It was really very clean room, comfortable bed and extremely soft pillows, spacious bathroom with extremely white fresh towels and with a nice view across Jakarta city.Hotel has good size outdoor swimming pool and not too much crowded.Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was so gorgeous with enormous unusual choice of world kitchen varieties: Indonesian, Japanese, Indian, Chinese and European cuisine.Please, take a seat and just take your time to enjoy delicious breakfast.We spent an excellent time here. One day, hope we will be back soon again.

If you're a first-timer in Jakarta, I would highly recommend Pullman hotel. The hotel was walking distance to malls such Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. There's an ongoing train construction in front of the hotel so you need to use the overhead bridge to cross to these malls. On the way, you could also snap some pictures of the monument and the busy Jakarta traffic at the roundabout. As the malls were nearby, you do not have to worry about food as food options were plenty.The only annoying thing was the busy traffic and the congestion but that's common anywhere if you stay around city area. The rooms were quite small but adequate and if you're lucky, you might even get a free upgrade. There's pool and gym as well, but I did not manage to use them. However, a friend of mine commented that both facilities were good.The best part of this hotel was their breakfast spread. So far, Pullman had the best and everything were good. You just had to go and experience it yourself. Overall, I would return and would recommend Pullman to anyone. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here twice and both times had to request change room because of the view. Had to pay extra for the street view. They should do something with the carpark view, no point paying premium but having no-so premium view. The room is slightly on the small side, chic. The bed is so comfortable. Loved the gym, pool area and the best part of this place is its breakfast spread. I love the lobster porridge! Had dinner here once too. Their FnB is really delicious. Walking distance to Grand Indonesia, and best time would be if you can book this place during car free day. They you get to absorb the people and culture around the famous roundabout. Once I was feeling feverish, a staff helped me to but painkiller, and gave it to me for free. Really appreciate it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Booked this hotel by accor advantage plus in advance to have a benefit for accor plus, but when we check in we informed that this hotel no longer has a cooperation with accor plus. we request from room upgrade but it's not allowed though that's available except we want to paid additional charges. And no breakfast voucher allowed also.Arrived at room, the room is very small and the bathtub is only for kids :(.The good things only the location is in the heart of the city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My 2nd home base. Reliable, great service and perfect location. Breakfast buffet is the best. Location is close to all hangouts and walking distance to Plaza Indonesia.Consistently reliable service and great location
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The very high level of service and great location of this really hotel stand out if you consider the rate, its a great deal when you are in Jakarta for business. its easy to get around from this hotel, the hotel has many options to sit and meet with colleagues and clients, and the accomodation is very comfortable allaround.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

already live in jakarta for 10 years, but it's the first time to stay here.hmm.. i'm just to speechless.because, the room was so perfect!it have living room, kitchen set & bath tub.OMG, we also got 1 night for free just because my fiance is a member of accor chain hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying at the Pullman during three days for business and I was amazed by the gorgeous buffet for breakfast and lunch. The various food are qualitative, savorous, originally rooteds. the service almost perfect. For summaries, this is the spot to stay in Djakarta ! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was impressed by the building foyer and the ornamental stone floors. The reception staff were polite and well-mannered, handling any problems with kindness and understanding. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were well presented. There was as diverse a range of foods as I have seen anywhere in the world. It was fantastic to choose from Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian or European cuisine. All the food was presented well, freshly prepared and cooks were on hand to deliver any special requests. In all a delightful dining experience!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jalan Thamrin in Jakarta is a very Good 5 Star hotel in the center of Business District with easy walking access to Shopping centers too . Great service, very lively active lobby, very nice buffet restaurant with other outlets. And of course offers better room rates than other 5 star hotels in the Thamrin Roundabout. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time to Jakarta and first time to the Pullman. Wonderful experience on all counts! Professional, caring, warm, personable staff to the person. Would come back again in a heartbeat! Yes, amazing breakfast! Best ever!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is in the city and quite near to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indo esia shopping mall. All the hotel staff was very warmth and friendly. The room was very clean. There were lots of food choices in the Sana Sini Restaurant. The fitness centre has lots of fitness machine, but the treadmill were a bit old. Hope they can change them to the new one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta compared to any other 5 star property wins hands down.Solid breakfast, business center, Gym, spa and rooms.No fancy dancy nonsense just well trained effective staff who genuinely care.Well done to the entire team you have made it impossible to stay anywhere else.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For the reasonable rates they charge to be staying in such a prime location, Pullman excels in many areas. I was made to feel very welcome by the doorman and the check in staffs. Room I had was a bit small but very comfortable. I had issues with the toiletries not being replenished and choice of pillow, it was dealt with very quickly. I ordered room service which was delivered promptly, was piping hot and delicious. The breakfast is really worth getting up early in the morning for, with such huge selections from Western, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese etc, it's so amazing, and staffs were also wonderful. The hotel is an easy walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, 2 really huge and upmarket shopping malls. The iconic roundabout fountain is very close by, as well as tramsway for transport. Right now, the underground train is being built. When that is completed, it will offer amazing convenience to going anywhere without the worry of the dreaded traffic jam.All in all I had a very pleasant 3 nights stay and will definitely choose to stay here again in my future visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

as a big and fancy hotel "Pullman" is giving you all enjoyement.bright and colourful lobby with very stylish sofavery secure with kind security and stafbig mall just face to face with this hotelFinally I found my fave food, remind me of Japan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had one night staying at Pullman Jakarta and I was impressed. I was upgraded to Deluxe Apartment and it was great! I am overwhelmed with great hospitality and excellence service, got the chance to have a look at the option of the rooms, personalized greeting cards, and so many things. From all the hotel experience I had, Pullman might be the one my heart falls on. Huge selection on buffet divided by food origin is one of the thing I love about Pullman Jakarta, although the layout makes me a bit confused and lost in restaurant (because I just want to tasted all) I am looking forward to be back soon
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spent 5 nights here in one of the standard rooms. I cannot fault the location, hotel or staff. The breakfast buffet is the best and most extensive I've ever had, has 5 different big stations catering for western and eastern tastes. The place itself is modern and well appointed. Wi-Fi was excellent as was the choice of English language TV. Staff were brilliant and faultless. I used the laundry also. Location is very central and opposite big malls etc. Short taxi ride to all the sights. My only gripe is that the standard rooms are on the small side compared to some other similar standard places I've stayed at. Hence if you can afford it upgrade the room. Otherwise the staff, location, facilities, decor etc etc are faultless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again I stayed at the Pullman in Jakarta CBD and as usual I enjoyed my stay. Staff were friendly and the rooms are roomy and clean. I really enjoy the breakfast there as it is like being able to taste the food delights of various cultures. One thing that I was disappointed with however as a Gold Accor Le Club member I requested an upgrade to executive for and they came back with an offer of approximately AUD 80 per day which I thought was very excessive as I already had paid to have breakfast included.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a frequent traveler, I am very meticulous and demanding when it comes to the quality of hotel facilities and service. I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin for the first time over the Valentine's weekend and I can say that the hotel is perfect and flawless both in terms of facilities and service. I booked the room (at hotels.com) for a little bit over USD 100 per night (with free breakfast buffet) and the quality of the room and facilities totally exceeded my expectations. Most of all, I would like to commend the exceptional service provided by all the staff in the hotel--from the front office, guest relations, housekeeping, to food service. The hotel is also conveniently located right across three of the biggest malls in Jakata--Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia, and Thamrin City. There are literally hundreds of options for shopping (from high- end, mid-level, to low-end) and dining (Grand Indonesia has three floors of international fast-food and fine dining restaurants for you to choose from). I highly recommend Pullman Thamrin and will definitely stay here again on my next visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in the Deluxe Executive Room in the Pullman Tower for 3 nights on our first stay in Jakarta. Location of the hotel is excellent with two major shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia) just across the road. There is currently major road-works on Jl M.H Thamrin which means that you cannot just cross the road, however there is a pedestrian overpass about 50 metres up the road, so certainly no issue there! It has been mentioned before, but the security is quite high and when entering the hotel in our airport transfer (which was organised through the hotel (400,000 IDR), the security guards diligently checked the vehicle, including the boot, bonnet and in the glovebox inside the car which made us feel safe, especially considering some of the other lax security measures in place at other venues. Upon entering the hotel we were escorted up to the Executive Lounge for checkin where although there was a minor miscommunication regarding prepayment of the room, this was handled efficiently and with extreme professionalism by the staff which was a standout and something that lasted throughout our entire stay. To top it all off, the staff (about 8 of them!) came out with chocolates/cake and candles singing happy birthday (my husband had spoken with the hotel the day prior), which was both embarrassing but extremely touching! This is one hotel we have stayed where we felt more like family than guests, with all staff going above and beyond to meet and exceed our expectations. Little touches such as addressing us personally, remembering our meal/drink preferences and offering insights into a local's life in Jakarta...all this combined to make it an awesome experience! Regarding the actual hotel, the rooms are spacious and well equipped with all the amenities one would require for a comfortable stay. Again the attention to detail flows over to housekeeping who had noticed a blown bulb in the bathroom and rectified that day before we even noticed. The gym is well equipped and open 24 hours and the pool is large with a number of sunbeds. Another big plus was the on premise hair salon which was approx $40 AUD for wash, cut and blow-dry...great value and an excellent cut!Overall we really can't fault the location, facilities or value of this hotel with the real standout being the staff, which will be the reason that we return and stay at this hotel the next time we are in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed over for the weekend for our Valentine's celebration. The parking spot which is quite far from the lobby and it is not underground, was initially making us complained a little. But it was a blessing in disguised, we had to walk under the rain sharing one big umbrella inseparably. We stayed in for relaxing weekend and had dinner at the nearby restaurants in Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendly and efficient service from check in to check out. Rooms are very well appointed with amenities and essentials. Super comfortable beds with choice of pillows. Sumptuous breakfast available at Sana Sini or, on 2nd floor, if you are staying at the executive floor. Extremely friendly staff who remember you if you are a repeat guest. Last but not least, excellent wifi connection throughout the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had not stayed in a Pullman before, and it was a very good experience.The public areas were clean and excellent, and with excellent service in both the cafe and lounge bar. The buffet breakfast was great, and the ambience and food in the restaurant at night was also good.The rooms were extremely well appointed and large, with lovely bathrooms. I would highly recommend the rooms.The hotel has a lovely pool, and a good gym. I could not find an adverse comment, save that I wanted a haircut, and it turned out that the hairdresser could not style hair, so I refuse the appointment!The location seems good for business, although the traffic in Jakarta is diabolical and you need to leave for any meeting in good time!As a result of this experience, I would stay in a Pullman anywhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I find the Wellness Centre good and well maintained, even not too big, but clean and modern. It has nice Whirlpool, steam room, sauna for men and women separated. The service for member is also interesting, they give promotions and compliments as well. ( a member of Wellness and Spa )
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Chose to stay here 1 night for my husband's birthday. Was upgraded to a premium superior room, which has a view of the malls opposite, which was a great plus! Check in staff was genuinely polite and we were checked in within minutes. Room was spotless and bed/pillows were all comfy. There was a slice of birthday cake for my husband when we arrived, which was a nice touch. The breakfast buffet was superb, so many tasty choices. I especially liked the desserts section, yes desserts for breakfast :) One of the best breakfast buffets i must say. Overall a fantastic stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin during the Lunar New Year 2016. This was close to the car bomb incident a few weeks back.Security was strict. First time I had my vehicle inspected inside out from bonnet to the back.Check-in was a breeze with a small gitch... welcome drink for only one couple whilst we booked for three couples! Sent an email to the GM and this were sorted out within 6 hours, impressive GM! (Reads emails on PH).Stayed at room 1015, 1021 and 1101. BIG rooms, spacious comfortable and well equipped. Local and international power point sockets available. Very friendly, courteous and knowledgeable staff.F&B - only had breakfast there. Full international spread from Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Continental and American choices. Had to plan carefully as not to overindulge. Shopping centres just across the street.Had extended check-out time until 1630 when we requested until 1530.Departed with a little sadness,wished could stay longer! Transfer to airport was OK at hotel end, but Jakarta jams are notorious! Best to give 3 hours grace period.There is no higher grading then promising to come back again!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Joined the wellness membership this month and satisfied so far. Prompt response from Pak Franzico, the manager, interesting offer and membership fee. The pool was nice and quite wide for exercise. A separate kids pool is very helpful to divide the crowd. Fresh lemon infusion water are refillable at all time. I would prefer to bring my own bottle to reduce the plastic waste.I always close my exercise with very nice, warm and smooth ginger tea (wedang jahe). A real treat for member!Tips: Ask the staff on duty to warm up the jacuzzi and the steam room 30 minutes before.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We have enjoyed our second stay in Pullman Central for 4 days. We are family of 8 and booked 3 rooms. Also studio family rooms. The rooms was not as large as u expect with the price, but afterall... its all new stuffs and clean. The restaurant is excellent. Service was fine. And the location is excellent !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was previously in Jakarta I stayed in the jw Marriott. The Pullman was far nicer a hotel and better value. If you can afford it I would suggest not getting the most basic room. The hotel has good facilities and has a nice modern feel. The restaurant is also great. I suggest having a look at the a la carte as the menu is great. I would definitely stay again when I Jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We changed hotel from Sari Pan hotel to this hotel because the terrorism happened some days ago.The location is the same convenient with Sari Pan.Sky bar, shopping mall and restaurants are all near the hotel.This hotel looks very new, so all the facility in this hotel are better than Sari Pan. The room is smaller than Sari Pan, but the price is a little higher than Sari Pan.(about 50 USD higher)Dinner at the restaurant at lobby is good, have so many choice.But the price is a little high.Well, it's not a bad choice for business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

maybe it was me the one who made a mistake in the booking, but I dont expect a very small room where only hobits would fit in the room view was also a concrete roof and i think it was parking lot terrible view, terrible room, small pool the only great thing was the location, the rest... are just disappointment
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay here regularly for my business trips to Jakarta because I find the staff here are nice and friendly. Special mention to Zemmie, Diana, Suci, Bodriah, Sari and Hari from the Café. They really make the stay an enjoyable one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really enjoy my time at the lounge with the best service I get from the staff especially Irma and IrviI. After a hard day work chilling out at the lounge is the best place to be. Our team will always meet up at the lounge and spent a lot of precious time together after work with the best service of the staff. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Jakarta Pullman on Thamrin NOT to get mixed up with the Pullman Central was a wonderful business and pleasure stay. The amenities including an amazing outdoor pool and top class gym were available during great hours. Certainly the New Deluxe tower has much more space in the rooms then the old tower and also a great Executive Lounge. The Breakfast buffet was absolutely wonderful and looked more like a Sunday brunch at most 5 Star resorts. Overall the service was spectacular and the property is centrally located in the heart of town right across the street from two main shopping centres. Wonderful 5 nights!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice and pleasant stay at pullman with my family. Comfortable, cozy room. Good service. Good food at Sana Sini restaurant. Nice view at busy and hectic yet interesting Jakarta. Definitely will stay again there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is good, you can walk to the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, some of the largest malls in the city. I had a huge bathroom with separate stalls for the toilet and shower booth. The tub was very large and nice and I'm sorry I didn't get to use it during my stay. Their pool and gym is also average nice. However, I had extremely bad experience with their breakfast buffet. They offer a huge impressive selection of food to choose from, chinese, indian, korean, japanese, western, you name it. Something I ate the first and second day upset my stomach during my entire stay of 4 days. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best part of staying at Pullman is that you are really treated as a family. Each ( I mean everyone working in this prestigious hotel) will do their best and do the extra mile just to make your stay memorable.Me and my fiance stayed for two (2) nights for a staycation and were very amazed with the experience that we had. From the check in, leading to your room, amenities, and the food served were topnotch. I am urging everyone to stay in this hotel and experience one of a kind service not only from one person but the whole property itself.Prepare to be amazed and I'm very sure you'll be back again because we are definitely staying here again. :)See you in Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

me and my partner choosing for staying this hotel for spent our new years eve holiday. the staff really friendly and helpful specially on the swimming pools area.. i gave my thumbs up for Suhadi and Chocky/i.. On the new years eve when the swimming pool full of people, they organized very well. since the room hotel that we choose had access the executive lounge.. i fell in love with lounge.. yogi and his friends, always welcoming us with warm regards. And for the room service menu.. oh my partner really love your burger and I'm so agree with that.. excellent.but we kind surprise with the new years eve they offers to us,, to spent on the backroom you need pay $500/couch and get one spirits.. and I will says NO Thank you.. the cleaning service need to be improve.. but for the rest is perfect.. but thanks again we had great moments to stays with you guys.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the price was soo high... but it beyond expectation.. little bit dissapointed, since i found a cockroach at my toilet. but its ok, the room was nice, and great, especially the location, at the district place of jakarta. breakfast so good. so amazed with the chef there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We looked at a few hotels before selecting Pullman Hotel & Resort. To our surprise it is really a great place to stay.good facilities. We spent 3 days and enjoyed every moment, good mixture of hotel guest from different country's.Plaza Indonesia nd Grand Indonesia is about 200 meters from the hotel lobby if your missing your daily fix. The staff at this hotel is very friendly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is Key.as for the rest, food is below expectations, rooms are small even after upgrade.I'm loyal since i'm maintaining status with Accor, but basically if it wouldn't be for the location and status, i would go other places...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Right in the middle of Jakarta, this is an impressive hotel. Staff were very pleasant, rooms comfortable, wifi good and the breakfast spectacularly good! Breakfast restaurant (also a lunch and evening restaurant) is divided into various cuisine areas: Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Western, ... Terrific food and exceptionally helpful staff. They even have Bintang beer on tap (we discovered in the evening). The hotel seems very safe too, as you need to pass through two separate security areas to enter it. (One shown on the photo)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice hotel but rooms are a bit small and outdated. You pay more for the central location than anything else. Shopping malls around are full of american and overpriced brands. Good if you're in town for business and not paying. Otherwise, there are a lot of nicer places a bit further out of downtown for a much better price. Taxis are really cheap anyways.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for a seminar and I truly enjoyed the room and especially the incredibly wide breakfast spread. Hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city and is fairly near to some shopping malls. I would strongly recommend this hotel for business travelers
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On arrival the receptionist welcomed us in warm hands and attended to administration stuff with no hassles. Check in was only about 3 minutes. After handling the room key to us, he directed us to where we were going to stay over and advised us to contact him if we need assistance.The grand deluxe room and spa-bath were scrupulously clean and tidy. We bathed on arrival and enjoyed the bath.This Pullman hotel staffs were wonderful with a bounty of information and recommendations. Our four night stay in this property was everything that we needed to enjoy the city of Jakarta.We enjoy our stay. Ryan and Pullman Staffs, thank you for your hospitality
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Highly recommended.. The room is very comfortable and clean. The location is just across Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia which is very convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is very nice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i stayed here back in June 2015 and wrote a review the day i checked into the hotel as things got off to a very rocky start. Normally its not something i would have done but if you read my original review you would realise why as we were obviously upset with many things at the time.i did try to reply earlier to my original review but couldn't as i had to wait 3 months before i was allowed to leave another review. sorry its taken me this long but i just want to say a HUGE thank you to all the staff who turned things around and made our stay very enjoyable and memorable for all the right reasons. special thanks to a lady by the name of Dina ( hope i remembered correctly) who went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect.i dont want to go into to how things were fixed just say a huge thank you on behalf of my family as you made us feel special.thanks again and will be back later this year.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a wonderful stay in this hotel. This hotel has exceptional standards and staff are highly attentive. Beautiful and clean room. Great location near shopping district. Good selection of restaurants and bars. I can't recommend this place enough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is a short walk from Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia making food and shopping within easy each. There's plenty of Bluebird cabs around if you want to go to Monas (National Monument) or Kota (the old city).The service was ordinary. They don't get out of their way like some better hotels but they aren't in any way bad neither. The room was comfortable, in contemporary style with a great view of the Welcome Indonesia statue. The security was extra tight as they'd scan your bags each time you enter the hotel. I suppose that's a good thing. The WiFi was free and stable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at this property over Christmas in one of the suite on the top floor. Top main concerns are:1. Water pressure is quite poor. We asked the engineer to take a look but was not helpful. Bidet pressure was realky ineffective.2. Air cond was set at the minimum level... it wasnt cold enough for us3. Extra bed charge was quite expensive - about half price of the room rate and their excuse is this includes breakfast.Other than above, breakfast was satisfactory.. plenty of options.Pool and spa facility was awesome too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Pullman after all and so it has to live upto the standards and it does. The staff are efficient, albeit a bit over-zealous in welcoming you before you reach the reception for check-in. The rooms are comfortable, neat and clean, though the light switches are confusing at times. The best part is the restaurant that serves a buffet dinner in the evenings and breakfast in the mornings. It's huge and spans some 5 different sections, which come alive as stations serving different types of cuisines during dinner - local Indonesian, Japanese, Western/Italian and Chinese. It's absolutely worthwhile and loveable. Overall, it's a good hotel to stay in a good and central location, but nothing great about the hotel, except the food.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for 3 days for my Christmas holiday. I was looking forward to a relaxing staycation and this is exactly what Pullman Hotel provided me. I love their selection of food for breakfast, their warm and inviting swim pool which you can use even in the evening, their cozy bed and neat (although a bit small) room, a variety of cable tv channel selection, and white fresh towels! I appreciate their friendly staff who have good English speaking capacities! The hotel is strategically located; just about 10-minute walk across Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. I would love to have another staycation here someday soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for 3 days. It deserves 5 circle for great service and friendly staff.We called the room service at midnite to fix a curtain in the bathroom and the maintenance guy came in in less than 5 minutes. Location is also great..less than 10 min walking to Grand Indonesia. Would love to recommend others to stay here. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great food, great breakfast, great staff, great pool, great Wi-Fi, great spa, great gym, unique position. I will always come here everytime I'll come back to Jakarta. In front of the Grand Mall and 30 minutes walking from all interesting places in the city. Wonderful, I love it
-------------------------------------------------------------------

this hotel is in a strategic location. but for that price, the room wasnt that big so we need one more bedroom. the access to malls is easy, especially grand indonesia, plaza indonesia, thamrin city and tanah abang
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrived at the hotel around 4pm, tight security checks prior arrival which assured me of my safety as a guest as their top priority. Was briefly checked in and had to wait for around 15 mins whilst the housekeeper did the checks on the room. Was given a set of keys in which did not work the 1st time,went on down to the lobby to get them validated, however, was given keys to another occupied guestroom. Was then attended to by Angga, who managed to get the right set of keys and rendered his assistance with the check in and rooming process. Thank you to his prompt action and service recovery, which I am grateful for. Hopefully this incident doesn't occur in the future, should I stay with you again on my next trip to jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

one never runs out of options to shop and eat as Pullman is located right opposite Plaza Indonesia mall and is at a walking distance from Grand Indonesia...Rooms in Pullman suit the business traveller - but the service is outstanding. gym is modern & functional, and the buffet breakfast is simply the best...they have a wide variety of food available...tourist attractions such as national monument , istiqlal mosque & national museum can be easily reached by the free tourist bus that leaves from the stop opposite the hotel.. overall an amazing experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel for business travellers. Very close to the big shopping malls of Jakarta. The rooms are high quality but very small. The breakfast is excellent. a huge selection of all kinds of food from all over the world.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When you stay at this hotel, get the package that include breakfast too. The buffet breakfast is one of the best, it offers Japanese, Chinese, Western and Indonesia food as well as fresh squeezed juice. If you pay separately for the breakfast, the cost will be higher so make sure it includes in the room package. The spa, sauna and steam room is also excellent, although not too big, it offers hot and cold jacuzzi as well as steam and sauna room, included in the room charge. To go to the mall, Grand Indonesia or Plaza Indonesia, you can use the bridge outside of the hotel to cross the street. This hotel is especially very convenient if you plan to go to the Germany embassy, which is only 100 meters away. Overall, this hotel is the best value hotel in the center of business district in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great stay and great location, the Pullman offers great service and proximity to various malls and restaurants. Modern trendy rooms, great breakfast buffet, very enjoyable modern bar service snacks and food. Friendly staff. Even though you might get frightened by the traffic surrounding the hotel, it is very easy to walk across using the walking bridge and to go for shopping or a light meal in one of the huge malls located walking distance from the Hotel. Really enjoyed my stay and the room and staff. Will be back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We booked 3 rooms for 3 nights (10th to 13th December 2015) at the Pullman Hotel at Thamrin. When my taxi pulled up to the entrance of the hotel, I was surprised to find out that Pullman Hotel looked better than I had expected. I was greeted with very friendly security staff even before entering the hotel. Then again, was greeted very warmly by Ms Sari who accompanied me to the reception for a very smooth check-in. As I had arrived early in the morning, the staff were very kind to allow me to check-in to an available room. I was very impressed by the Christmas decorations and lovely Christmas music could be heard throughout the hotel. It's conveniently situated very close to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia shopping malls. The room was very clean and well-maintained. I would give it a 5-star rating for this hotel. The outdoor pool was beautiful and gym was very big as well. As for the restaurant, they served the largest spread of buffet in a hotel that I've ever come across! Thank you very much to the Management and Staff for keeping the hotel in top condition. I certainly enjoyed my stay and will be back again soon.Patricia
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The usual stay but the service of the hotel was fantastic and beyond expectations. On my way to the airport I forgot my passport in my room safe. The duty manager that Saturday morning did everything to bring it to me as fast as possible while coordinating with the hotel representative at the airport. They succeeded and I got my flight. I want to thank them both and anyone else who helped.I would recommend this hotel and will return on my next stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Really excellent hotel, suitable for business and leisure stay - albeit probably more of a business focus. I've spent approximately a month at the hotel over the past year - 2 weeks in May, a week in September and a week in December.The style of the hotel is simple and contemporary, lots of glass and a general black and white colour scheme with the odd bit of contrast. Standard size rooms are ample, and the next size up ("Supreme") is frankly a mini-suite.Hotel facilities are excellent, the Sana Sinai restaurant is brilliant with frankly the world's largest and most ridiculously comprehensive food selection (spanning Indonesian, Western, Chinese, Japanese and many others) and is reasonably priced given the hotel. The spa and gym facilities are top-notch, I believe the pool is arguably the best in Jakarta given its size. Security is good and recently enhanced.By comparison to other hotels in the proximity, the Mandarin is darker and the Grand Hyatt, whilst more traditionally luxurious, is in my personal opinion a bit naff (lots of gold metal), but that is of course a personal preference thing. What makes the hotel however is its staff, and this is what really sets it apart. The staff at the Pullman are fabulous, could not be more helpful or welcoming and are reason enough to stay here.The only minor gripe (and its minor) is probably the cost of the hotel laundry service. This is a regular bug-bear for any major hotel, but it is at the point where you're almost better off buying new clothes at the adjacent series of shopping malls, but that's an industry thing.In short, frankly if you're staying in the CBD area, you'd be mad to stay elsewhere.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed two nights at Pullman Jakarta and I expected more. Fortunately we could benefit from a travel agency rate and we didn't pay the full price.It was good but nothing special. Our room was located in the old building and the room was everything but spectacular. The room itself was tiny but you still have everything you need to fulfill the 5 stars requirements. I'd recommend customer to make sure, they are staying in the new building.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I always come back to Pullman every time I need a weekend getaway.. So far I always had an early check in at 12.00. Maybe it was because most people come here for business purpose so not so much people had late check out. For myself, I always request a later check out at 2pm. Enjoying the shopping mall across the hotel and had a good quality of sleep at night. I also like to work on the business area on the lobby. In the morning, you can go to Bunderan HI for car free day. There was this one time I woke up late at 9.15am. I was feeling very bad to almost lose the time for breakfast. But do not worry because their breakfast ends at 10.30am!!! So I still can enjoy my favorite hotel breakfast in Jakarta. It also a perfect hotel for New Years. Gosh I really love this hotel..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

very nice hotel with good location, clean room and great interior especially the toilet with romantic translucent design. the stuff there are very helpful and friendly. will definitely stay here again next trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed 2 nights in this hotel . This hotel have good location, big and clean room. Staff is friendly. Food is ok. Only thing is the rate is quite high , but what you pay for is what you get for, so it is not bad. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia and what attracted me was the central location which is ideal for my travel to Bekasi and Cilandak Commercial Estate. This hotel is also located across the road from Plaza Indonesia and Mall of Indonesia where there are lots of restaurants.Pullman Jakarta Indonesia might not be the newest hotel but the place is well maintained and the rooms are nice and clean. As a Le Club Platinum member, I was upgraded to their Deluxe room which is very spacious and the bed is very comfortable. However the shower water pressure is quite weak and it is very difficult to adjust the water temperature probably because of the low water pressure. The WiFi strength is also quite weak and only 3Mbps although there is a stronger WiFi available but at extra cost. At this wireless age, free WiFi should at least be at 5Mbps strength to be adequate.Sini Sana restaurant has a very wide choice for their buffet breakfast. However it is quite irritating to leave your seat to take some food and come back to see that the wait staff has cleared away your table. The same thing happened to another guest who was sitting a few seats way from me and he also looked quite irritated. I can understand if the place is very full and they need to clear up fast to allow other guest to have space for breakfast but on that morning, it was probably at 25% or less of its sitting capacity. Other then the above minor irritations, I am happy with my stay here and will be back on my next business trip to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location of this hotel is in a strategic place near from bundaran hotel indonesia, grand indonesia mall and plaza indonesia as most visited mallThe room for standard is not big enough but comfortable and the pillow is very soft, i really love itThe most i like is the food (breakfast) which are many choices there are western food, Chinese food, asia food, Japanese food. I really like Chinese food it taste delicious but the others also delicious. You will not have a boring breakfast even you stay long not like any other hotelsRecommended place to stay in Jakarta 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the Pullman on a business trip, and selected the hotel for its central location and convenience for the Plaza Indonesia shopping centre.Although the room was on the smaller side, it was well appointed, comfortable and clean. The bathroom did not have a walk in shower - I had to step into the bath tub - but the pressure was good.The staff were very polite and efficient, and the breakfast buffet selection was extensive.I would definitely stay there again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

really like the restaurant we had for breakfast, nice jakarta's street view from there. also tons of choices/menus for breakfast with great numbers of delicious fresh juicesbut still manage to understand the pullman room standard (same with the one that we had in Kuta, Bali) with huge clear window on our shower room, so the people on the bedroom can see the whole view in the shower room, LoL
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were there for a short getaway and it was excellent. We stayed in the suite and was really clean and spacious. Walking distance from the malls and good options for food. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Buffet was great and we enjoyed the spa too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Service is very personalized. Location is very centrally located for business as well as shopping. Deluxe rooms are spacious with Coffee machines, deep bath tubs and standing showers. Great House keeping       
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good hotel, the room is a bit small since it's of an old building just recently renovated. They're going to be separated w/ Accor group, thus the benefit of the member is not much. I wouldn't recommend for the AccorAdvantage member to stay here.Else, all is good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time I am staying here for business. Used to stay in Grand Hyatt. The hotel facilities & rooms fit a certain level of standard & expectations. Unfortunately, staff service are very lacking as compared to the hardware. I think the most polite staff I have met is the bellboy. Will stay here again only for the location & hardware. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second stay at this hotel. The breakfast buffet is extensive and excellent with Asian and Western food stations. I stayed in a grand deluxe room . My advance request for a desk was noted and fulfilled. The laundry service was excellent. I was able to use the gym and swimming pool and enjoyed both. The gym treadmills are equipped with TV's and sanitized headphones are provided. The Thermin Gate Jakarta Plaza is across the street where one can find a supermarket , restaurants and high end shopping. The WiFi was up to the job . The staff make me feel pampered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay one night at Grand deluxe room, well designed, clean and large room. Location is a strategic area surrounded by shopping centres, restaurants and office building. Staff are well trained and friendly. Great breakfast with various kinds of food. Value to stay and we for sure will come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 3 nights in Sep 2015.Located in the middle of the city and everything is there at Thamrin Area such as Restaurant, Shopping mall, and Office Building. Room was well renovated and looked new, I tried some other hotel in Jakarta but room at Pullman is actually better than some other 5 star hotel even with lower price! Had no issue at all during stay and this was perfect for the business traveller.Staff were very friendly and helpful when I asked for help.Traffic was always bad in Jakarta but at least you have a peace once you step into the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like this hotel as I've stayed here several times. However, I was so surprised to learn that they don't honour the Accord Advantage Plus Platinum cards for discount in the restaurant. Service was not good this time with Accor Plus membership: no escorting to Executive Lounge upon check in, no complimentary upgrade, and the Executive Lounge scrimps on cocktail buffet choices unlike in other Accor Hotel Executive Lounges in Bangkok, Phnom Penh, and Hanoi. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Impressed with my three night stay in Pullman Jakarta. The location is very good and the service is excellent. Also very pleased with the gym (24h) and spa area so if you are travelling for business and wish also to work out then look no further. Excellent value for money.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is in a good location, near 2 big malls, several restaurants and bars/clubs.There is a decent gym and pool area and the breakfast is very good. Staff is helpful and always greeting you with a smile.Agree with other reviews about the room size....they are quite small compared to other hotels in a similar price range.There is also a spa in the hotel and went there for a massage. Was disappointed to be honest and for the price they charge, you are better off going somewhere else around the hotel area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were here last week and stay here on the weekend, and it is our first stay in Pullman Hotel. Room is small, yet it was so compact we were so surprise, it got iron and the ironing board (!), lots of mineral waters and good variety of tea, bathrobe and yukata, big comfy pillows, comfy bed and a generous bathroom (towels and toilet paper). the idea of making a shower inside a bathtub is also nice. It is easier for us to do the "wudhu". We didn't bring our prayer cloth and easily borrow the "mukena" from the hotel.The location is perfect, we spent the night hanging by the walking distance malls, and in the morning, since we didn't book the hotel with breakfast we join the car free day (it was Sunday) right there in the heart of Jakarta, and enjoyed a healthy morning with street food breakfast.Staff are nice and warm. it was a very pleasant stay
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am thoroughly impressed with my 3 night stay in Nov 2015, at Pullman Jakarta at Jalan Thamrin. The improvements they made to the service and comfort puts this hotel as one of the top performing hotels anywhere in the world, in my opinion.I stayed in the Deluxe room and it checks all the key points, everything you need and more are provided. Comfortable bedding, clean room, WiFi access, amenities included, plenty of drinking water available, etc. I never had to ask the house keeping for anything.The Internet access throughout the hotel is now hassle free! Easy to connect, no silly passwords required. Fast speed too. What a relief! Very few hotels in the world can match its magnificent breakfast spread with its wide variety of foods to cater to everyone: Indonesian, Japanese, Indian and Continental fare.The attentive staff at all times; I was greeted and pleasantly welcomed and acknowledged everywhere I went. The Pullman greeters at the door are doing an excellent job, especially Diana.Grateful thanks and kudos to the staff of the Pullman gym, Reza and Aisya, who found my swim goggles that I left at the pool and returned them to me. They were keen to assist and importantly, honest people.There are many more good people in Pullman Jakarta hotel, who I did not mention their names but they all made my stay a very welcome one indeed, e.g. The helpful front desk staff who recommended a wonderful running route to the Suropati Park.Most importantly, it's the people of Pullman Jakarta hotel that made my stay and I am confident that they would do the same for you. Highly recommended and now most definitely, my first choice of hotel to return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is one of the best I've stayed in. Location is quite central, but of course expect the traffic in Jakarta and there's no train. Rooms are clean and large - pullman style.Breakfast has variety of choices with very large and yummy food. Loved the coffee machine where you can have your coffee in take-out cup.Staff very friendly and helpful. Always with smile and ready to help.If you want a nice relaxing vacation then this is the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic location ur right smack in the centre of Jakarta!It has the BEST breakfast ever!HOWEVER i hated that stupid shower.U are actually showering in the bathtub.The pressure is such a let down.Sincerely i hope the management look into it with upmost urgency.When everything else is up to par except for the shower dept.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

No greeting when i was stay, when i need concierge assist me to the room, he only assist me untill the elevator, also the operator, when i call for borrow a scissors, she transfer my call to concierge and no body pick up, what the..........???!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is gorgeous and has all that you expect from a five star hotel. I must say, the one thing that surprised me was that the rooms are quite small - well equipped, but small. I think if my husband had been with me, we might've felt somewhat cramped. That aside, I loved my stay. The staff are exceptionally friendly and willing to assist. The breakfast choices seemed unending, but I did not partake. I had a few room service meals and they were excellent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The pros:Location - right across Plaza Indonesia.Breakfast - extensive and fabulous buffet spreadClean and relatively new roomsFriendly staff - no problems with EnglishThe cons:Tiny rooms - good for only 1 guest per room.No soundproofing - conversations along the corridor can be heard in the room.Not value for money considering the size of room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here on 22-26 Oct 2015.Most of people stayed in this hotel was for bussines n work while we stayed there for short holiday.Comfy bed n pillow, just the room n bathroom a bit small for a 5 star hotel but still ok tho.Nice pool on 2nd floor, and since people are working we could have whole pool just for the 2 of us!Walking distance to 2 biggest mall in Jakarta, Plaza Indonesia n Grand Indonesia so u don't need stuck in traffic only for shopping. U can see Bundaran HI the famous Bundaran HI.My partner isn't a morning person n we both doesn't have meal until 11am so we decided to book room only but we tried their breakfast buffet and its nice!wide range selection of food, taste ok, healthy juice n most of all delicious pastry!The staff are nice n helpfull, they help us book dinner in Skye restaurant for my belated birthday.Just one note, while we stayed in the hotel there is a construction going on, it seems from upper level of our room 420 and the sound pass thru our room. Its hard to take a nap with those noises.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really enjoy the stay here, nearby to my office just walking distance and several shopping mall. Feel welcome by the staff especially from the front desk team, pricing quite reasonable and among the cheapest in my opinion. The thing that I really enjoy staying here is their breakfast, lot of variety and really good. Will stay here again on next visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

still the pullman with good location, reasonable price, easy to find the food, just opposite side of Indonesia Plaza, very convenience. I was stayed in same hotel was called Nikko, the new renovation is good.The breakfast is excellent, more choices to match different customers.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason I always return to Pullman is because of its staffs from the Concierge to The Front Office to the Room Service to the Restaurants staffs. They are always warm, sincere and ready to make your stay enjoyable and memorable.However, I felt the rooms needed to be upgraded especially the washrooms as it is the few without rainfall showers. Also the water pressure could have been better.This trip the internet service was also not too good with intermittent service especially in Sana Sini Restaurant.If not for the long serving staffs that have provided great and warm hospitality I would have certainly checked in to other newer hotels nearby.Let's hope the hardware and match its software. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is excellent, is located opposite two great malls.Staff is very friendly and helpfull..buffet breakfast offer anything u can think about western and asian cuisine...in short this Jakarta hotel excel in all u can expect staying at a Pullman hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I am an Accor Gold Member, I have always been upgraded to a better room, except during this visit. Apparently the Pullman was very busy and I could not be accommodated. That was a big disappointment, since I was there for my wedding anniversary with my wife..  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from the pricing (this might be also due to the price level around...) there is not too much which resembles one of a Pullman Hotel except the name board on the building.I have been staying at other Pullman Hotels in South East Asia (Pullman G, Pullman King Power, Pullman Central Park) and can not get the real Pullman Feeling here. The rooms are tiny. Except you book the right category and opt for an upgrade (as a Platinum member I was lucky enough). Still the old Nikko atmosphere is around the rooms, aisle and executive lounge.F&B could be improved in the lounge. How about some Austrian wines as the new GM is Austrian?Do hope the new management will be able to improve and get this hotel where it might see itself already. For the moment there is still a long way to go.Take Pullman Central Park as your benchmark.Keep the pace.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's good hotel and quite staff friendly foods good be happy when you are there good sightseeing and good place in the centre of city price is guait Haigh but it's worth I hope make good price for rooms 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is very nice, is in an area surronded by hotels and central to the downtown.Reception is luxurius and spacious, gives you the sense of warm welcome, thanks to the concierge, or the many assistant at the main entrance of the lobby or at the help desk. Unfortunately the room I have it's quite small, if you have your luggage with you this will reduce your living space too...just a small table as working station. Breakfast area is huge and with a variety of food selection, in the evening this becomes a restaurant where you can have an occidental or asiatic food. The quality is good and what is important is the cleanliness of the whole straucture. It's worthy of a pleasant stay this hotel. Just in front of it there a huge mall with famous brands, but I found it very expensive, in some cases more than in Italy. Everyone can be impressed by the amount of security checks and policemen spread all around any hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On business trip - 6 nights.very spacious lobby and huge restaurant spaces. Team very cordial and prompt. The lobby manager on my first night deserves praise (checked in on 20th September).The rooms a bid small but well stocked and designed. Amenities are good. However on the 3rd day the towels replaced had a very foul stench to it. F&B had large spread of food for all sort of tastebuds. Location of the hotel is a winner, right amidst the business district and malls. so you can actually walk to restaurants and quickly shop too !Business lounges and meeting rooms were very good and well organized.One drawback, they would accept my Accor club membership card ! citing, the bookings were done through an agent and hence didn't qualify for ....i didnt bother to check either.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First, it was easy to book a room in their hotel and their representatives promptly attended to my queries about my reservation. Once you entered the lobby of the hotel, you will be amazed by the fragrance and the ambiance. All employees were accommodating and with all hospitality, they try to give the best service they could offer. I remember one foreigner who impolitely asked one of the receptionists in the hotel to change his USD because he needs to pay for his taxi fare. The receptionist handled the situation calmly and attended to the needs of the customer. (Tip: Foreigners should have it changed at the airport first thing they arrived.)The location is good but, expect busy streets in Jakarta. Anywhere is traffic. Especially now that there is a construction going on in front of the hotel.The food was great! They have free breakfast buffet with Western, Chinese, Indonesian, and Japanese delicacies, with mineral water, juice and a choice of black coffee or tea. After breakfast, you can also dine at their restaurant (Sana Sini) but I suggest you pay for a buffet. It's cost-effective, though they only offer coffee and tea with it. Bottled water costs 55,000 IDR. Room service is also available but the food are expensive. Again, buffet is highly recommended.Restaurants?! If you want to utilise their restaurants, they have two. One at the lobby of the hotel and the other one is at the other building, Wisma Nusantara, a few walks away. Both restaurants offer reasonable prices with great food. If you want the city view while having your dinner or lunch (highly recommended at night), you can go to Kayangah Restaurant at Wisma Nusantara, located at the 28th floor. They offer Teppanyaki and Shabu-Shabu. You can either pay with cash or include it in your hotel bill.Our room is a superior type. Hmmm…. The view from the window is the parking lot and parking area of another building though. I booked a room for two but they only gave 1 toothbrush with a small toothpaste (not so happy with that). It has a bath tub and installed speakers in the bathroom if you prefer to soak yourself in the bath tub while watching your favourite movie (this I love so much).If you are looking for a place to spend the night (bar or clubs), there is one near the hotel, at Plaza Indonesia, 6th floor. There are also bars in the hotel though, but didn't try.Shopping? Highly recommended! Walking distance from two big malls (Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia) Well.... Jakarta is a city of MALLS anyway. :-) Just be careful and be vigilant in walking to the malls coz you will passed through the OVERPASS and there are different kinds of people scattered all over the place (If you know what I mean). If lost, ask the guards and not random people there.Taxi? Receptionists can book a cab for you wherever you want to go. You can pay in cash or again charge it to your hotel bill. Just be reminded to tell them if you want a regular taxi or a limo. They use BLUE BIRD company anyway. Highly recommended. However, if you are budget conscious, you can use the regular blue bird taxi. Ask the guard to get their body number if you want to be sure of your safety. Remember to save the number of the hotel as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 2 nights and will definitely come back! Location is great (2 min from Plaza Indonesia), Pullman is a great option if you want to stay in a super central location but don't want to over spend at the Mandarin Oriental, the Grand Hyatt or the Kempinski (which are all next to another). Pullman is a 5 star hotel with great rooms (we stayed in one of the deluxe newly renovated rooms), great service and a great breakfast. It is much cheaper than the other 5 star hotels in the area but still delivers on service and amenities. The only thing that could be improved is the pool area which is very basic. Staff was fantastic from check in to breakfast to bell boys.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the central area of Jakarta. Walking distance to the Plaza Indonesia Mall and the Grand Indonesia Mall, and also the TransJakarta BRT Sarinah Station. Taking the BRT line 1 (red line), you can reach the Merdeka Square and the old town. Two popular tourist attractions in Jakarta. Room is spacious, clean and tidy, with a big, comfortable bed. Nice, large bathroom with good amenities . WiFi is fast and free. Friendly and helpful staff provide excellent services. Asian and western style buffet breakfast is abundant and delicious. Participated in an international conference here. Enjoyed the stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Got a good price with group booking. Near to 2 big malls, plaza indonesia and grand indonesia. Staff will greet once a guest with luggage stepped into the lobby area, all ready to help. Checking in and out were smooth and staff were smiley. Room was cosy and bathroom slightly crowded but with bathtub. Must try the gym, swimming pool and sauna/steam room downstairs. Breakfast and lunch was good with lots of variety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room no 1453 (44sqm)Lift access: from the lobby turn to the left. View: the Thamrin Gate and MH. Thamrin main roadBed: king size, firm mattress. Amenities: all you can imagine. I love the complimentary TWG tea set, daily 4 bottles of water. Free minibar (two beers, four sodas, three juices, one perrier, one evian; nuts and chips) replaced daily. Executive lounge access: free breakfast, free afternoon tea, free cocktails. We visited during the weekend so it feel like our private lounge. Weekdays are busier. If you are a breakfast person, the main restaurant has much better food. Pool: 1.5 m depth. It's an okay size. They have kids pool too. Gym: good enough. Not extremely big, but it has all the equipment. Staff: extremely attentiveFive minutes walk to the famous malls (Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia). But if your main reason to visit is the mall, Hotel Kempinski is a better choice. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the central of Jakarta, Pullman is very convenient. There are also some mega malls within walking distance e.g. Grand Indonesia, which makes shopping and dining easy too. The hotel rooms are modern and have adequate space inside. The breakfast area, however, deserves a special mention. It's so large and carries such a wide variety of cuisines that it doesn't seem like it's just meant for breakfast. The seating areas are also nicely decorated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a few issues with the booking of my stay however, the duty manager was there to listen and come up with solutions. So what could have started out as a problematic reception ended up all sorted out. Staying in lots of hotels I often see a wide range of customer service but the best hotels have managers like this one who are there to solve problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Love my stay in Pullman. Was a pleasant stay. however i felt the room was small and the toilet felt very claustrophobic. Location is great as it is nearby to the big malls but a connected bridge would have been fabulous! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Central hotel in Jakarta.just walking go to shopping centre (infront the hotel Plaza indonesia and Grand Indonesia),Room to small but enough for solo traveler, very modern and so clean, complete amenities, wifi so fast, and very best bedroom. Bathroom too small. Breakfast complete and enough for morning power.Love this hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta used to the Nikko Hotel. It was re-branded a few years ago and has been newly refurbished. Although the standard rooms are rather small, they are clean and well designed. The service is also very good. One of the highlights of the hotel is its buffet breakfast spread. There is a wide selection of food and beverages and qualify is pretty good. Last but not least, the hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the city with 2 of the largest shopping malls in Jakarta (Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia) within walking distance. Overall, good value.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, my stay was pleasant. The security of this hotel was really good with the baggage scanning and room keycard. The buffet restaurant had variety of food range from Japanese to ethnic Indonesian. The only downside was the staffs. Their lack of English ability surprised me and needed to be improved.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When arriving at the hotel it looks like any other hotel... but once inside it feels different. The security check on entry is no big deal, getting used to that. The staff is very friendly, from the people at the door, to the staff at check-in as well as the people in the bars and restaurants. Especially when arriving after a 16 hour flight, you want to feel welcome. And I did feel that.Staff brought my luggage to the room without delay. Just what I needed. Due to the fact that the hotel was fully booked there was no king bed available anymore - I was informed about that up front, so I got a twin bed room on the 4th floor. The room has all you expect a hotel room to have and the quality of the bed and the selection of pillows makes sleeping here a great experience.Only downside of the room is the size of the bathroom. Bit small to my liking, but it's clean, the shower is hot and what more do you need.The room was provided with plenty of complimentary bottles of water. The size of the wardrobe is limited, 2 suits and some shirts and it's full.The breakfast is awesome - almost too much choice, but everything delicious.If the hotel would make the check-out process a bit quicker, it would be helpful.I'd definitely recommend this hotel for business travellers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel room is really big and it is so centrally located that you get to assess to two of the biggest shopping centre. The location is smack right in the city centre just like Singapore's very own Raffles Place. Security is very tight. The check-in is efficient and there are several cafes and restaurants. The most important highlight of this stay is the breakfast spread. It has so many varieties that I dont know where to begin! For a moment I thought I was having a dinner buffet at a hotel and not breakfast. To make thing interesting that the different type of cuisine has their own set of complementary utensils. Like for the Chinese food section, they have those Chinaware and you can find Japanese style design plates and bowls in the Jap section just to name a few. Oh yes... you didnt read wrongly it is such a feast even for breakfast!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Like many of the top hotels in Asia, the Pullman provides excellent service in a pleasant environment. The front of house staff were pleasant, helpful and friendly. The rooms were very nice and the amenities were appropriate. This property would have gotten 5-stars but for the quality of the food.Although they had incredible variety of food at the breakfast buffet, i cannot say that the food was good. Some of the food showed signs of having been re-heated too many times, spent too long in the bain marie or under a heat lamp.I had dinner two nights in a row at the bar with the chemical symbols and was disappointed both times. I had an uninspired burger served with fries from freezer bags. The second night I thought I'd go local thinking that you cannot possibly screw up nasi goreng. I was wrong. The fried chicken was dry and tough. The satay were poorly done. I am sure there must be other restaurants in the hotel which are could be excellent but i didn't have the opportunity to try them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time I stated at the Pullman in downtown Jakarta. I normally stay elsewhere. The staff were very very friendly and helpful. On arrival all the staff could not have been more helpful. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Bathrooms are very spacious fresh and clean. Ironing facilities in the room are well kept and iron was very clean. There are a number of bars which had some very attentive staff in respect to service. Breakfast in the morning was filled with a wide range of food from traditional Asian to cereals to fruit and freshly cooked meals with plenty of choice in respect to juice. Taxis are plentiful so no waiting. Overall the hotel provides for all your needs when in Jakarta on business. The hotel is close to the Jakarta conference centre. Highly recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Used to Nikko hotel but fully renovated and nice room for new one. Best location in CBD area and easy to approaching shopping area and other Hotels.Best breakfast buffet ever been. Even Japanese sushi served in BF time and never retreat to spend time in this hotel. Fully recommend to all. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I happen to be with my colleague had a meeting at this hotel. We tried the bagels at Makaron the bakery there. It's quite light and good but rather a bit expensive for $8 or IDR120K though. We can have the same quality of sandwich for half the price at other places. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i love staying in this hotel and love to stay again. this hotel have a good service and great view. very sophisticated near HI circle and easy to look around and near major shopping malls when you get bored in room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel suits for business travellers as it's centrally located in the heart of Jakarta. Major shopping malls, such as Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia, are within walking distance. There are also a wide range of options to dine in around the area that will not break your budget, such as around Sabang and Wahid Hasyim area (about two blocks from the hotel). Public transport is also accessible, including the Trans Jakarta bus. The room is spacious and very clean, with good amenities and supplies, including a coffee machine. Service is good and the staffs are very friendly. Although the hotel is located on the main road of Jakarta, you cannot hear the noise from the traffic. I would recommend this hotel for business travellers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

located near HI circle , well connected hotel. value for money as you can choose rooms for choice from budget to up class. new wing room are quite big with all amenities. kemixtri gastro bar is good to have light meeting. wide range of selection for breakfast in SINI SANA. food quality is good enough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was back to Jakarta for business recently; and have once again requested for Pullman due to its excellent location. First, I was delighted that the check-in was swifter than my last stay. Though the room is not really big as the last one, the air condition is definitely much cooler this time, as I remembered complaining about it the last time but to no avail. This time, the Standing Lamp and the Shower pulling mechanism were not working! I did not inform the front desk as I only stayed for 2 nights. Well, the main STAR attraction is the buffet breakfast at the main lobby instead of 2nd level. I must say it is haven - especially the selection of homemade breads as well as bakery and several choices of fresh juicers. Also, with a nice hot cup of latte each morning completing with great service from the team, it is really awesome!. Well, keep up such improvement! I may be back soon...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It a nice hotel .. for those have little budget this hotel a not recommended. .it a bit expensive for the room but very comfortable and clean .. the staff also very friendly. . Must try for those who really wanna relax.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my second stay at the Pullman in central Jakarta (there is another one at Central Park, further out). As per my first visit, in October 2014 the Pullman remains a top class hotel in every respect.Firstly the rooms are spacious, modern, clean and well maintained. The rooms were very quiet, and I did not hear any noise from my neighbours nor the corridor. On my last visit my room had been at the front of the hotel, and there had been some limited noise from the engineering works to install a new metro system at the front of the hotel. The only gripe I had about the room on both occasions was that there were no light switches at all on the right side of the bed (a little frustrating last thing at night). The rooms at the back of the hotel are slightly smaller than the front, so you have to judge size versus less noise!The hotel breakfast is sumptuous in its range and quality. There were 4 separate workstations, each offering a different style of cuisine for breakfast (European, Indonesian, Chinese or Japanese). Each work station offered either pre-prepared buffet food or you could order special dishes at will. I was spoilt for choice every morning.Each night I headed to the shopping centre across the road to eat, so can offer no comment on the hotel restaurant.The hotel has a proper swimming pool (i.e. you can swim real lengths, and there is a deep end for diving). There is also a smaller splash pool for children.The gym is well equipped and maintained. The changing rooms have steam room, sauna cabin, ice bath and jacquzzi.The customer service is generally very good and welcoming. On my first visit I had problems with staff pretending to understand basic requests in English, and then completely failing to deliver. On this second visit the staff service was improved and I had no problems with people understanding me. The location is great, right in the heart of the city. There are two massive shopping centres immediately next to the hotel. While the ground floor is a sea of luxury brands, there is plenty of more reasonable priced fare on other floors, and lots of choice for places to eat in the shopping centre.The free wifi was of a high standard and worked throughout the hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't had a good track record with this property. Everytime I stay here, something is sure to happen. Hoping that this trip will differ. For this trip, slight hitch during check in but no big deal! Another point to make is that the hotel no longer has Accor Advantage Plus dining privileges. An advantage is the restaurant was empty in the morning. No more bustling with people. You can have a nice quite breakfast. Food spread was still as good and I had a most wonderful bowl of Javanese Bubur! However, I believe it will hurt the property revenue eventually. Otherwise, everything was perfect during the stay. Renovation is completed and looks great! Exhibition halls are up and the executive lounge is ready. Another mention is I had the opportunity to meet Mr Alexandra Poindl, GM of this property whom has only taken over for a few months. However, must compliment him for a great job done so far, you can definitely feel the difference!Great location and very courteous staff.Will definitely be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is very nicely refurbished and has a cool & modern feel. The standard rooms are nice and functional, with desk, chaise longue, and queen bed, but are small, more Hong Kong size. You can still walk around the bed and room enough for suitcase, so it is not annoying. But if you are two and plan to spend day-time in the room I would recommend to book a bigger room or look somewhere else. Still, overall I like the hotel very much. Service is top notch and very friendly. Lobby is great. But best of all is the breakfast buffet. Asian or western, it is a huge spread. I travel a lot worldwide and at many top hotels, so I can compare. This is one of the very best breakfast buffets worldwide. Location is excellent: very centrally located and minutes walking from two of the biggest shopping malls, Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. So highly recommended, especially for individual business travellers or shoppers.

I have stayed with Pullman Thamrin even before it was Nikko Hotel. While it was quite nice being a Nikko Hotel, I must say that Pullman Thamrin definitely pick up the slack ever since taking over. One of the key improvement points is the level of staff service. Upon arriving at the hotel, there will be at least one very friendly concierge lady bringing you to the check in counter. Check in is usually quite effective and fast, unless there are few flights arriving around the same time in which there will be a need to wait.The room as compared to the predecessor of Nikko Hotel was made actually much smaller. I guess they want to capitalize on the space with more rooms but if you have ever stayed in other hotels around the same area, I would think that this is one of the smallest one in this area (compared to Hyatt or Intercontinental). Despite its small size, it manages to fit in one bath tub in the bathroom (though the bath tub would probably not fit an average sized Caucasian man well). I guess if there is anything that I'm bothered with, it is the room size. It is really one of the smallest and I'm an average sized Asian!However, if you are able to live with that amount of space, the hotel is definitely a good place to stay put. Apart from the service level which I cannot stress enough, the other highlight of staying with this hotel would have to be their breakfast buffet. I have stayed with many hotels for biz trip around the Asia regions, but by far, Pullman Thamrin offers the WIDEST range of food available. I often joked that I would have to go have breakfast right when they start which is 0530 (if I'm not wrong) just so that I can have everything. So, if you are thinking whether the breakfast is worth adding to your room package, think no more!Pullman Thamrin is located at one of the most convenient places in Jakarta if you are into shopping. The two biggest malls, Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia are just opposite the hotel, minutes away walking.I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Pullman Thamrin everytime I'm there. There were times I wish the room is going to be as big as when it was Nikko Hotel but I quickly get over it when I see how friendly the concierge staff is and how wonderful the breakfast is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The moment we stepped into this hotel, we were overwhelmed by its contemporary yet warm interior. There's a bit of a combination of art deco & modern Parisian touch at the lobby. The staffs were very polite & accommodating too. Securities were tight with luggages & shopping bags checked but not even once did we feel violated. Smiles were aplenty and help quickly offered without even the need to ask. The rooms were also as good as the lobby, if not better. They were spacious with a view of the ever popular Plaza Indonesia. It was so convenient for us to go to the other parts of Thamrin as the pedestrian bridge was just next to the hotel. The breakfast buffet was a real treat with a variety of food served. A satisfying experience staying here indeed!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed at this hotel numerous times when visiting Jakarta.Just one request early check in should allow to an exception guest (repeating guest) specially after a long 24hours flight from JFK NEW YORK-JKT. I also disgusted seeing another guest walking around at the lobby and restaurant with a hotel slipper . Hotel slipper should only allow to wear inside hotel room NOT outside the room!

Had a full-board meeting last month at this hotel..The meeting room was great. Very fast WiFi, tasty foods and cakes. Superb location. This is truly a great place for meeting purpose. But I can't really say the same about spending a night in here. The room was fairly small and looked old. And the bathroom was just too tiny that you cannot move freely inside the bathroom. Not what I expected from a pullman hotel caliber.But what disappointed me the most, is that the implementation of "no hotel slipper policy in the restaurant" was poorly implemented. When I arrived at the restaurant using hotel slipper, the waiter suggested that I should change my hotel slipper into something more proper, which I gladly complied because I respected the policy. But when I dined in the restaurant, I could still see lots of people (mostly foreign tourists) wandering around the restaurant using the hotel's slipper. And when I asked the waiter about it, she simply said that she didn't saw them using their hotel slippers when they're coming in. I was really not satisfied with that kind of answer, so I ask for explanation from her manager instead. And sadly, I got the same answer from him which is kind of disappointing. I really feel like they served their costumers unequally. But well... What can I say? I was just some unsatisfied local guest back then :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed two nights in a superior room for a business trip. Rooms are clean and tidy though may be a bit small. Very close to shopping malls like Plaza Indonesia. One thing I noted was that the room appeared a bit cold when the temperature was set at around 25 degrees so from time to time I had to turn off the air conditioning. Also note that the side of the bathroom with the bathtub is separated from the sleeping area by a glass panel - not sure if it is typical for some of Accor Group's hotels because some rooms in a hotel that I had stayed in Shanghai before have the same feature.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've now stayed at this Pullman hotel several times when visiting Jakarta for business, and it's become one of my favourite hotels. The staff are aways eager to please and efficient, and the service levels are very high. It is relatively small, but well planned, with good space around the lobby and an excellent lounge where a speciality Hot Chocolate is served at Le Chocolat. The hotel's food is very good, both in choice and quality, also there is quite a wide choice of wines. The location is wonderful - right in the heart of Jakarta with only a short walk to the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia malls. The guest rooms are quite small - typical for a city-centre hotel, but they are also very comfortable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel matched all my needs. I have traveled to Jakarta many times and stayed at many hotels. This one is the best for value, location and quality. They offered a very good limo service to & from the airport and to business meetings with clients. Staff were very helpful. Having two large shopping centers opposite was a big plus.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this hotel especially the location. Had been staying here for more than once. Walking distance to Plaza Indonesia and when I happened to be in Jakarta on Sunday, I could go to the church service just one building away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff excellent service Good buffet Rooms great and modern Location beat in town BUT in THERMIDO I think so seafood dish there was wine used but they had not mentioned until I asked them and they told me yes , since I know that dish cannot be prepared without alcohol SUPRISE for a Muslim county we think and they say everything is halal Pls management should mention it on the tag if any wine is used 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in the grand deluxe room. Totally satisfied with the amenities and services. The down side of it was just the room is small (with the 'Grand' name, though it was bigger), the espresso machine were not functioning (didn't have time to report this), and the air-cond were a bit warm to me. However, the breakfast buffet spread was splendid. So much varieties, and delicious. Opposite of Plaza Indonesia, 3 mins walk to Grand Indonesia, and 10 mins walk to Sabang, no complains. Enjoyed my stay here. Will be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not a great fan of 5* hotels, simply because I stay in a lot of them. My idea of a vacation is a quiet pub somewhere. But, if you are going to be pampered or have business in Jakarta, this is the way to go. From the swift check-in, to the helpful dispensing of taxi money, to the best bakery this side of Paris, to the enormous swimming pool and first class gym, to the wide range of excellent wines and superb catering in the bar, to the fast internet and universally helpful staff, this is a hotel that can stand up to competition anywhere in the world and is a testimony to what first class management can achieve. Absolutely no complaints at all, and to top it all, incredible value for money. I can recommend unhesitatingly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my 2nd stay and Spent 2 nights only for the weekend in Jakarta. Overall stay was great. Arrival experience was pleasant. Intan at the front desk was helpful and nice, i came too early but fortunately i did not wait for long time as i supposed to. Room is bit small but very nice, very good wifi access in all area. Housekeeping team is wonderful as well, clean and very tidy. Thanks to my room attendant Elita and Egi for their service. Breakfast is just amazing, wide variety of food, great quality and super service from waiter named Suci. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. Thank you Pullman Jakarta Indonesia 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good hotel surrounded by some very expensive one. The rooms are clean, modern and decent, definitely, four star – yet the price is half what you can expect to pay across the road at some big names. The breakfast is one of the most extensive I have seen with over eight separate food station each serving a different style of food. That alone is a good reason to pick the Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the only five star quality hotel at a reasonable price , which is conveniently located in Central Jakarta. The hotel itself is walking distance to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia, however the bridge that is used to cross between the hotel and the mall is not wheelchair accesible and not stroller-friendly. The room itself is a little bit small but it is very clean.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is certainly better than its sister Pullman in Central Park in terms of location, convenience and amenities. The lobby is spacious with areas for those who like to watch the crowd and private areas comfortably tucked away for those who desire a little privacy out of their room. The mezzanine can do well with some wall art, reading areas or a games room. For now, it looks a somewhat forlorn. Like its sister hotel, the reception staff needs more training in service and to anticipate the needs of its guests rather than wait to be asked otherwise they are rather friendly, efficient and courteous. The room I had is spacious and has a good view of the city lights in the night.Located near the Grand Indonesia and a host of other good class hotels, there is no shortage of places of entertainment and dining. It should be better when the subway is up and running in a few years.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overal satisfactory. I had problems with my credit card and felt so awkward. But the staff made me comfortable so i felt ok. Anyway, staff are efficient and breakfast is enjoyable. Worth coming back again. Rooms are comfy as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 4D3N in their superior.Came in the evening with no hassle of check in. Less than 5 mins. Good wifi is available in the hotel compund.Nice room but lil bit pricey.Good location With just crossing over the bridge in front of the hotel, you will reach Plaza Indonesia and Grand. Many malls to roam around. 10 mins walk to Thamrin city.Breakfast is awesome. Large spread of buffet menu. Too many types of variety to choose.Taxi (Silverbird) is always ready at the hotel compund.Pool is awesome with All just side by side with Spa, gym and locker with shower ( sauna & jacuzzi)Daily replenish of minerals water and tea coffee bevarages. Definitely will come back to stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had 2days meeting, meeting room was good. No major problem. Friendly staff. Location is nice, even though you have to watch the 3in1 schedule on Thamrin street. Food was very good, tasty and nice variety.Stay in 4th floor facing Plaza Indonesia. The room was not so big, but nice. Bathroom was clean, but it also small.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotels in Jakarta are pretty expensive by Asian city standards. Although the Pullman isn't cheap (my city view room was 2.2m per night incl breakfast), it is very competitively priced compared to its neighbours. The hotel is is a good location - close to the biggest shopping malls and a 20 minute walk (if you can stand the heat, pollution, noise, traffic) to the National Monument and palace. The road is closed to traffic between 6-11am on Sundays, and this is when Jakarta smiles. Everyone seems so much happier!Personally, I came to Jakarta as a leisure traveller with an open mind, but it's a city which is hard to love. A couple of days is enough to see the monument square, mosque and Kota Tua (which is by far the most interesting part of the city). And that's about it really.Gym is excellent - lots of modern equipment. The outdoor pool area is also excellent, but 2 things which could be improved:- there isn't outdoor bar, but they don't offer service by the pool. Instead of being visible and helpful, the staff just hide there out of sight. It doesn't help that a large display of shrubs hides the bar from the pool.- the music is in a one-hour loop of about 12 tracks. Some of them pretty cool, but some of them (especially the weird jazz stuff) really irritating. And it's the same every day. Every hour. If you plan on spending a day (or two) by the pool, bring some headphones or beg the staff to change it as it will drive you insane! Similarly the gym also has a 12 track loop on all day every day, although this is less of a problem if you only spend 30-45 minutes in there!On the subject of music, there is piped music on each floor/lift area which to me seems a bit tacky and unnecessary. Doesn't really add to the atmosphere.Although I wasn't won over by Jakarta, The Pullman made my stay a lot more pleasant. Great room, great view, the best buffet breakfast I've had in a hotel (probably), excellent staff and service. I never usually eat in hotels apart from breakfast, but I ate at the Pullman three times in the evening because the food is exceptionally good. Andi the sommelier is great for suggesting good wines to enjoy with your food.Apart from the music, the only things I could fault are:- the staff cleaning my room kept forgetting to clean the cups and replenish the coffee. They are housed inside a drawer so it's probably easy for them to overlook.- the bathroom ventilation didn't work, which meant the mirrors were always steamed up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at this hotel many times before. The location and price are reasonable. The service is great and they just finished their renovation earlier this year. But that's just for the interior and restaurants. For rooms, a bit old and this time I got a broken hair dryer and a broken speaker in the bathroom. Will I stay here again? Maybe. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I would consider this an above average business hotel. It is in the centre of the city, built at a roundabout where all the good hotel chains are located (Hyatt, etc.) The Pullman is the cheapest but not less luxurious. The service level is very good. All staff are very friendly and go out of their way to make you stay comfortable. They have three restaurants. One in the hotel itself and trowel outstanding ones in the building next to the hotel. All in all perfect for a business trip. I stayed there for five days and it felt sort of like "coming home" at the end of the day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location,good breakfast and the service was very good,a room are clean,staff are nice and smiling...definitely we will stay in this hotel again when we go to Jakarta...we suggest for traveler to stay in Pullman jakarta Indonesia is the best hotel in Jakarta 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is good placed in downtown. around the hotel you can find shopping center and restaurants. the rooms are big and clear. if you need to have your peace for a good sleep, you should try to get a room not facing the many road, otherwise you will hear the traffic all night long. otherwise the hotel is perfect for a business stay. the included breakfast is fabulous
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well kept rooms, Quite rooms, Good Food and right next to a large mall - made me not miss a thing during my visit. I really liked the food in the bar cum restaurant and the live music was lively. Breakfast was included in my booking but found out that it is an expensive option and the cafe in the ground floor is not cheap neither. The hotel has an option to book for airport transfer which can be paid at the desk - i found it useful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great location , and price is reasonable compared the other 5 star hotels around the same location. Security check was good too .. I feel the safeness during my stayed & staff was friendly . The only setback was the spa , I took an hour massage with body scrub , shouldn't we have either the scrub first or massage first or V.V, but this gal massage my back and the scrub after the back massage, It was like hell of pain overall I don't enjoy the massage at all !The Breakfast was awesome !!!! I love it with good spread !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a superb location for business traveller and for tourist to experience Jakarta City. There are several great shopping malls nearby ie Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. The best day to explore Jakarta City is during Indonesia Public Holidays, or during weekend ie, Saturday and Sunday. This is because during those days, we can avoid to spend too much time stuck in road traffic. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel and good value for money , friendly staff , high speed of wifi , comfortable room , super clean room, satisfied but superior room is very small but is okay if it's for couple(2people) , near mall , everything is good ! Great experience!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a chance to return to Pullman Jakarta on Thamrin in the middle of Jakarta right after Idul Fritr holidays. The place is quite busy yet remain calm and nice. The location is undeniably advantageous in the heart of Jakarta across two major shopping plazasm and for business. Besides the location, the hotel is well managed and breakfast stays attractive. So get a room with breakfast and you will not be disappointed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well located, around shopping centers and lots of restaurants. Hotel hall is fabulous, lots of space, well decorated. Welcoming staff and fast check in / check out. Breakfast is one of the best I ever had, lots of choice and all well presented. Nice pool and spa. Drawback: size of the room, which is really small and is ok for a single person (no place to open you suitcase). I complained about a humidity smell: immediate answer from the staff, yet they did not solve the issue (just put some parfum to hide the smell, but I think there was a real issue). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent the Hari Raya weekend in Jakarta. Hotel was perfect. Located near big shopping malls and restaurants, all within walking distance. Rooms were very elegantly decorated, big and spacious, and very well maintained. Service was excellent everywhere - from reception to housekeeping to the servers in the restaurant and most especially in the executive lounge where service was very personal (staff knew us personally). Executive lounge served a la carte menu throughout the day. Special thanks to the hotel management who made sure everything was perfectly arranged before our arrival and during our stay. The best Pullman property I have stayed in! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A very smart hotel but very friendly also. Very convenient for business but also a lovely pool to relax in. Lots of variety in the hotel restaurant. A good location for travelling to other parts of Indonesia. Breakfast has lots of variety too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Beautiful place in the heart of Jakarta.As a Gold Member (sad to have downgraded from Platinum though), I was welcomed very warmly by the great staff of Pullman. From the Security to the Front office.Since I was still celebrating my anniversary, I was given a major upgrade to a much bigger room at no extra charge. Who says membership doesn't have its privileges? Go get your Accor Loyalty card now.Throughout my 7 days stay at the property, I am greeted personally (as in name) by staff whom I have not introduced myself to. From the Bell hop, to the receptionist, to the greeters. They seem to know who are their guests.Even the Bar Manager knew what my check-out date was and wished both my wife and I a safe journey, when we were have a nightcap. The attention to details is just immaculate.The brekkie is good. A wide variety for you to choose from. Local Indonesian fare, Japanese, Western, Chinese. Gosh. If only I could eat every single item available. The lunch buffet? Don't get me started. Brekkie was good, lunch was even better.A few minutes walk from Plaza Indonesia, where you can indulge in a little upscale shopping with branded labels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best hotel for me. Staff were sincere providing customer service. Staff would even refuse the tips im giving to them, amazing people! Food is good. Check in is quite fast. Hotel security is at its best. Staff would call you in your room just to check if you're ok or if you need anything. Impressive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

During our short stay in Jakarta (4 nights), my husband and I stayed at the Pullman Thamrin. This was our first time at a Pullman Hotels and it was a great experience. Definitely, a well-run hotel where ALL staff are so friendly, happy and polite. The hotel itself is well located for touring and has many shopping locations nearby (should you wish to shop). Although, there are many restaurants near the hotel, we chose to eat at the hotel as the food was so amazing. Although, there are many taxis available at the airport, we chose the pick up service from the hotel, it was also excellent and problem-free.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was affordable relative to all the other hotels located in the Jakarta CBD. The room was admittedly smaller than the other hotels I have stayed in the CBD; however the breakfast was great and service was very good. They have nice cafes and restaurants to hang out for lone business travellers or just to relax and enjoy some alone time. The hotel is admittedly relatively old, but it doesn't show. The room sometimes smell a bit funny and the square pillows are not very good to sleep on. I suggest to change the pillows to normal ones when you arrive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay two nights at grand deluxe room in newly renovated wing of the hotel, its a splendid experience, room is nicely decorated, breakfast as fabulous as usual. Personally i thought Pullman Thamrin provide the best breakfast compared to other hotels in nearby area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We visited with a group of friends 2 weeks back during Ramadan.Pullman jakarta is centrally located. It is of walking distance to many good restaurants, fancy bars and clubs. In the horrible jakarta traffic, you really don't want to get stuck in a car/taxi.Service was excellent. I was unwell after a night out and the staffs hurried down to our assistance with wheel chair and sent me back to my room with no complains. Prompt and attentive. Breakfast buffet according to our friends who ate was of a sumptuous and delightful spread. Room was very clean, bed comfortable. We got a Room upgrade as my partner is a platinum member of the Accor group. Thus, it was value for money. Accor group, never fails to deliver good service to it's valued clients. Our only complain? We should have been told in advance that the pool was under going renovation. We were looking forward to laze by the pool. That was quite a disappointment. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room is so clean ,smell good.toilet and bathtub is so clean.and the Location is good, near shopping centre and restaurant. breakfast is amazing, delicios, good.for me this is perfect Hotel. you must try this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a nice stay..room and hotel clean. great location. Had previously reviewed their concierge auwful...but next day The guest experience manager Ms. Dina had shown great assistance and professionalism which made it up
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So, "pulang kampung" for Lebaran and we are bored with the usual places. We like the Accor brand and this place was offering a good rate so why not. We have lived in Jakarta previously and remember this as the Hotel President and latterly the Nikko so we were interested to see what it was like.Clearly a lot of refurbishment has been performed: the lobby looks clean and modern and a few nods to other Pullman styling we have seen across Europe and ME.The room too was clean and modern but really small - the desk clerk said 25m2 and had offered an upgrade to a bigger room at Rp800k ++ - we were basically just using it to sleep between family stuff so we declined. The bed was commensurate with the room size - it said "queen" but clearly a small queen.On entering the bathroom, I thought I was back in a house in England, barely enough room in which to turn around. The bathtub was maybe 4 foot long - I cannot be sure as I left my tape measure at home inexplicably - suffice to say at 5ft 11in, I could have only sat in it in a foetal position. So I had a shower.All that said, it was clean, and well-maintained.Buffet breakfast in the main coffee shop was fine if choice a little limited and the space itself was perhaps too small to cope with the Lebaran crowds - we came down on our last morning to be confronted by a huge queue of families waiting their turn. The staff sought us out as a table for two and directed us to the zeccy lounge. This was much more to my liking especially not having paid for it!Talking of paying for it, I like a drink as much as the next reviewer, but these prices were frisky. Rp85k for a Bintang. Rp160k for a glass of white wine. Come on, this is not Singapore!We scoped out the menu - Rp280++ for Ayam Taliwang, then Rp200k for fried rice, albeit enough for two it said, but in Jakarta at even a decent end restaurant you can get Indonesian food at much better prices.Overall: OK, but will probably use our default hotel in Jakarta next time we go and head for the Mulia...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed here a couple of times for business. It's in the center of the city and accessible to most places. The room is clean and spacious, and comes with a bath tub, and staff are friendly. Internet connection is free and decent. Breakfast here is amazing. So many to choose from and is very tasty. In the same roundabout there is the Grand Hyatt and Mandarin Oriental, but this one is really great value!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent a short 3 nights stay over at Pullman Thamrin during the Ramadhan month. It was overall a pleasant stay and I would not hesistate to return again - surpasses my expectation based on my previous stay at Pullman Central Park. Location: No doubt the prime location is an attractive pull factor - opposite 2 of the most luxurious shopping malls in Jakarta. It is extremely safe to walk over using the connecting overhead bridge. Just down the road is the Sudirman business district where most office buildings are located. Check-In: Reached Pullman at around 3.30pm and checking in was very smooth and efficient (within 10mins). Would be better if the FO staffs engage the guests with more interaction though they were very welcoming and friendly. Porter could have offered to help with the baggages.Rooms: Got assigned to a non-smoking city view room on the 9th floor. Pretty happy since my requests were acceded. Room size is small for Jakarta standard but it was cosy and sufficient for a short stay. Windows are able to be opened up which is a plus plus since AC could get pretty cold. It will be better if the bath tub and shower are separated. Room amenities are pretty basic. The idea of a working desk is good for every business traveller. Facilities: The swimming pool was closed for renovation during my stay which I was quite disappointed. Besides that, the hotel is pretty furnished with a complete range of facilities - from business centres, spa and wellness centre, convenience store, restaurants and bar. I personally thought that the varieties of convenience store pales in comparison (would be better if there are refrigerated drinks, instant noodles etc). Tried the inhouse spa and it was satisfying (special thanks to mba Neneng). Breakfast spread at Sana Sini was good too even though I only had it once. Check-Out: I would like to highlight the fact that the FO staffs are very helpful and goes beyond her call of duty. Unfortunately, I did not get her name and would love to address a compliment letter for her. Do advise the channel which I may write in to. The said FO staff very kindly helped me to pay for my last minute air ticket purchase via ATM at Wisma Nusantara after knowing that I don't have a local ATM card. Honestly, I'm really grateful to her. Love to compliment another male FO/concierge staff too. Conclusion: Overall, this Pullman property's exterior may looked aged but it is heartwarming internally. I would definitely recommend to my business partners and friends should they be coming over to Jakarta. It surpasses my initial expectation. The staffs of this hotel is their greatest asset. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In a busy city like Jakarta you need a place to relax, the Pullman is the place. The staff here are VERY friendly and service minded. The breakfast is the biggest after have seen, ranging from Indonesian, Japanese, Chineese and international traditional buffet. Rooms are large, Clean and very comfortsable so I can only recommend the hotel as a retreat, close to malls and major Companies, something you want when traffic is a constant mess. Enjoy your stay
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is really strategic, the hippest mall in jakarta Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia just across the hotel, and you can reach by foot.The service was also great, really helpful, polite, professional and they really maintain the guest privacy. I have some matters to do and they let me had early check in.The room was not large but very clean with excellent facilities and furniture. Unfortunately, the pool was closed until mid july 2015.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband and I are glad to be able to host our Engagement party at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. Service from the staff is marvelous! Extremely helpful and will go extra miles just to make you feel comfortable. We stayed in suite and oh boy, the room is huge. We also received a lot of good compliments from our overseas guests that the room is spacious and clean. Additionally, make sure that you try out their spa. The massage is awesome and relaxing. Price is pretty reasonable too. Also, Location is great as shopping centre is located just across the road. Highly recommended and I'm really looking forward to the next stay! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In my recent business trip to Jakarta 1/7 to 3/7. Thru a friend's recommendation, I tried out my stay at Pullman Thamrin Jakarta. I'm impressed with the service rendered, staffs are polite and helpful. My next trip there has no hesitation to stay there again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia recently (July 215) for business. The hotel was well appointed and the staff very professional. From the moment we checked in we were provided with a complimentary upgrade. My colleagues also received the same benefit. The reception staff were very efficient and helpful. The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable. The large "king" bed made for several restful nights. We stayed in Jakarta for 4 days and the hotel accommodated our needs from both a business and personal level. The gym is well appointed with technical equipment (running, rowing, bikes and elliptical trainers). There was free weights and weight machines available. The gym staff were very professional and obliging. The pool was in need of some repair but was available. It was my understanding that the pool was earmarked for repair later in July. Overall the restaurants and the breakfast menus were first class with a large array of dishes catering for a large and varietal cuisine. The bar caters or smokers and non smokers with an isolated room for non smokers to enjoy a wee dram after dinner. We were in Jakarta during Ramadan and the hotel catered for all their guests as well as external diners. A very comfortable and enjoyable stay, this is my second time at the Pullman Jakarta and I will return. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed this hotel for the business trip (almost 70 days), and really like this hotel. the location is in one of the central of the Jakarta, the tamlin, beside with the famous mall Plaza Indonesia and grand Indonesia, so the shopping is really easy. the room is a bit small, but comfortable and clean. the gym is good with the middle size swimming pool(I believe you can read books around the swimming pool and spend your lazy afternoon).the service is quite good and I feel they will do their best to support all of you want. something I like is the breakfast, you cannot imagine why they can provide so many breakfast every morning.. It take me 1 month to take the breakfast in this hotel(basically, I will get bored 3 days)and something important is cost is reasonable, you will never get this 5 stars hotel with this price. really recommend for the business trip staying.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff was very friendly,the room from bathroom to the room by self was very clean,the food was great,feeling very comfortable stay in great hotel when people are welcome you with great smile! I definitely will back with all my family for holiday on December and I definitely will recommended to all my family and friends in Australia!❤️❤️❤️ thank you!Trisha DaviesSydney,Australia 2000
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying here for a night for a weekend staycation. I proposed my special one there. It has perfect location as its only a short walking distance to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. I got a room with view to HI roundabout. Complete amenities. Smooth check in though i arrived there at around 11.50 am. Breakfast spread was awesome. But i was kind of disappointed because the pool was closed due to some renovation. I was also losing my patience while i had to call the housekeeping 4 times just to get more water and paperbag to pack my stuffs.Several times while i was about to exit and enter the lobby there was no one there to open the door for me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Thamrin in Jakarta is an excellent city centre hotel, located close to the government ministries and businesses as well as the main shopping mall - indeed it is connected by a bridge. It has a good restaurant with plenty of choice for both breakfast and dinner. However, you are seeking a much lighter breakfast I would suggest the café in the foyer which is much cheaper and serves good croissants and coffee. There is also a bar and chocolaterie on the ground floor. The rooms are of high quality and the service is good. For a city centre hotel it is also possible to get a very good nights sleep so highly recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stay at the hotel two times in three months for business trip and found the excellent services and location for this hotel. Especially, breakfast is very nice with very diversified and delicous. I love this hotel and highly reccommend for your business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The only problem that i had was that my room hd a terrible smell, so much that i had to move rooms.The room service was shocking, the food arrived cold and was tasteless.I liked the pool area.All in all i would say that there are way better hotels in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin for weekend. Best location with nearby big shopping mall, best modern and clean room, the food is great especially Sana Sini brunch and also the room service (I tried the Japanesse Salmon and my husband ordered Pasta). Easy and fast check in and check out process, friendly staff especially Ms. Bunga. Their bar also nice.It is a wow.. and looking forward to stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I came at 6 pm(18:00) and room not yet ready, I was shocked how come the room not ready while the room should be ready by 1 to 2 pm(13:00to 14:00) and asked me to wait for more 20 to 30 minutes more.. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is spacious, air con is sufficiently cool, staff are very friendly. The breakfast is heaven send, before the hectic day of meetings. Had a swim during the afternoon, the pool had a layer of oil - perhaps somebody's suntan lotion or the pollutions from the main street ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I booked a Grand Deluxe room and the room is aligned with other Pullmans I've stayed in the region; comfortable and massive.WIFI connection was really fast; something that can be quite a luxury in some business hotels in Jakarta and location is right in front of the Plaza Indonesia as well as Grand Indonesia.Service was excellent; very punctual with serving my Sahur (ramadhan breakfast) and staff was always happy to help with anything i wanted.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not my first time stay in Pullman Hotel Thamrin, I have always been delighted with the service and the hospitality of the staff. In room dining also great, the food was great, the taste and presentation just great. Check in and check out process were great too. Keep up the good work!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room was not cleaned properly, still hair on floor including pubic hair on bathroom floor. Informing the staff about it the only reply, "thank you for your feedback"Location good, right next to mall. F&B very expensive, dinner buffet about USD 30.00, a single soft drink USD 3.00. A burger USD 13.00. In addition of these prices a 21% service and government tax is charged at all F&B outlets. Better value for money at restaurants in mall.Rooms nice size and comfy bed, pity that plumbing from rooms above can be heard as water runs past through pipes. Cleanliness was the biggest concern.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely impressive. We checked in really early as we arrived in Jakarta in the early morning. As we were waiting for our room to be ready, we decided to step out for lunch to feed our toddler boy. When we returned, our room was ready, room key was inserted to cool the room, lights lit and our luggage was already in our room. Impeccable thoughtfulness! The room was very well kept and maintained and was such a comfortable stay. Breakfast spread was magnificently impressive too, and they are also very yummy!The 2nd day was my birthday. My husband tried to plan for a surprise for me and the hotel acceded by sending a personalized slice of birthday cake to me with compliments! This was our first visit to Jakarta and Pullman Jakarta Indonesia and would definitely be back! Those were lovely memories! The fitness centre and swimming pool are also very well maintained and clean. We love this hotel and would highly recommend!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

pullman jakarta was the best hotel i ever been. room was amazing, brand new and super stylish. bathroom was the best i ever had in a hotel, bathtube was really amazing. room service was very good. huge spa area with sauna and jacuzzi with a tv. pool was nice, even its in the middle of the city it wasnt noisy. the hotel staff was very friendly. the mall is just across the street. i would definetely choose this hotel again!!!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman Jakarta again, from 21 to 24 Jun, stayed at 4th floor smoking room.The Good1. The room size is excellent, and plenty of water (counted 6) was provided at various points in the room. I'm happy for that because I drink plenty of water and the standard 2 bottles of water usually provided by standard hotels are never enough. 2. There was plenty of fluffy towels and the toilet which was spotlessly clean. 3. The room even though it is a smoking room did not smell of it. Good ventilation. 4. I guess the wifi system probably an upgrade. It is definitely faster this time.5. Breakfast as usual, has a Indonesian jamu section, and a wide variety of choices. 6. Check in is faster now and less of a hassle. The front desk seems to be much better organised.The BadIts hard to find the bad points, that I had a pleasant stay but there are a couple of points that the hotel could improve on.1. The egg station at breakfast. Always under staffed and the cook is overwhelmed with too many requests coming in at the same time. I gave up asking for my eggs.2. There were at least 4 security staff at the door. When I arrived in a taxi from the airport, they just looked on and did not assist with the bags. The bellboy was away busy with other guests.Regardless overall I had a great stay and would come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently staying at the hotel and writing a review now is not something I would normally do. However I hope da review might fix the mini bar fridge as phone call fall on deaf ears.We arrived yesterday to modern looking business hotel we have a executive suite and were checked in the club lounge which is nice but not like a Sofitel or shangri la.The check in was brisk and were offered the afternoon tea to my dismay just cookies.Upon checking in I was told my daughter could use the club ammenities but additional cost. 500,000 rupiah plus taxes if she was to visit the cocktail hour. She is 9 yrs old and would have 1-2 cokes maximum. Juice is not a option. I understand if a adult to pay that much but for a child?? This meant I had to visit by myself as my wife had to stay with my daughter in the roomThe food was not pleasant at al. The cheese left a film of fat on your pallet.The room we have includes complimentary laundry 4 piece per day and comp minibar. Nothing mentioned upon check in.We called down to arrange the laundry to be bluntly told no complimentary just bed and breakfast !As i was in the lounge at the time I went to ask but the lady was not sure so had to check the system. problem quickly resolved and she arranged the collection for us.The mini bar doesn't work and explaining that to guest services was quite hard over the phone as they didn't understand at first. The fridge ended up being swapped over but still doesn't work. We were told they would swap again but it's still not done. Which annoys me as I would like a cold beer after such a hot day.When booking I requested a roll away bed which was not provided. Unfortunately I did a phone reservation so had no email proof of my request. Bed was quickly resolved though finding out the price was a challenge as the staff never knew and a few calls were made.Hot water - in the shower and bath doesn't exist had to shower in cold water. The sink however I found the water to be dangerously hot that you could burn yourself!!! In room hair dryer doesn't work in the bathroom socket provided now I have a grumpy wife who can't do her hair in front of a mirror. LolWi fi. The log in details we were given were not even close to what the actual log in isNegative out of the way. The actual room is huge / modern and beautiful.Just asi finish we find a few ants around the kettle
-------------------------------------------------------------------

beautiful hotel. i was not sure what to expect before we arrived. so i was pleasently surprised. the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small, but comfortable. breakfast is very nice. but not cheap. really enjoyed the stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family and I found this lovely hotel located in a prime area of Jakarta. We were thoroughly impressed by the warm and hospitality shown by the staffs the moment we stepped into the hotel. Everything was well taken care of and the breakfast buffet spread was really fantastic.. It was a wonderful short vacation and we will be back at Pullman Jakarta definitely!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed there for my besties wedding! Hotel room was well furnished! I really love their bed. It was really comfortable with clean and nice sheets. Breakfast buffet with great selection of Asian & Western cuisine. Furthermore there are giant 2 shopping malls; Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia that are only a walking distance away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a Jakarta Citizen, passing through this hotel everyday otw to office, The Hotel Location is superb, its in the heart of Jakarta. But unfortunately, Pullman has let down my expectation. 1st, they are now already not participate in Accor Advantage Plus program hence u can't use your AAP benefit. That is fine, as I want to experience staying in Pullman then i still give it a go. 2nd, They had a water issue (I stayed on May 30-31), we got brown water and have to wait for hot water (until I checked out at 1.30 we haven't had that hot water solved). My friend from overseas even thought it was a 3stars hotel!. 3rd long time waiting for check out due to point redemption confusion (altough, this is not bothering me too much), and when we did check out no apologies offered until we mention the problem. For a five star hotel we demand a more personal and friendly services which I didn't experience in Pullman Jakarta. But put all aside, they have a great location, very comfortable bed and a very vast selection of Breakfast menu.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed there and the stay was pleasant.. Staff was extremely friendly and we enjoyed being in the heart of Jakarta. Food was excellent and the hotel was spacious and comfortableWished we could stay a little bit longer to explore Jakarta and this area
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgraded to a deluxe room on the 10th floor to enjoy the extra space (and view) and was simply wowed. The room is spacious, luxurious and the bathroom is huge. The room also has a lounge/TV area. Slept very comfortably and had a range of pillows to choose from (even a pillow menu was included). The only thing I can complain about is the fact that we had to have cold showers on both nights due to water heating issues. The lobby is huge and marble-ous. Valet parking is also available. WiFi was fast and free. AC worked wonderfully. The view from the window(s) was pretty nice. Location is great, very central and close to shopping malls and restaurants. Good value for money. Didn't get to try the breakfast as we overslept on both days. This hotel screams elegance; would definitely stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thamrin is always a good choice to stay in Jakarta. Typical chain hotel. Good location in Jakarta, safe area, next to shopping mall. Highly recommended for business trips. Surely no way yo avoid the traffic jam in Jakarta:)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,I stayed one night in this awesome hotel. Lovely location and rooms are very fancy, modern abd very well furnished.In room dinning was very nice and tasty.Recommended for a relaxing weekendThank you
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed one Saturday night at this hotel. It is conveniently located in the centre of the city. It has a full range of facilities and it is all well maintained. There is a huge array of foods available on the breakfast buffet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent hotel with a very good location and an amazing breakfast.The room are perfect. .......... ...................................................................................................
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the superior rooms are tiny for the price, but otherwise it is comfortable. huge breakfast selection and wifi is reliable and fast. this property could have gotten a 5 stars from me but i decided with a 4 star rating due to the following:1) water in the toilet bowl is yellowish-brown when flushed. could be a pipe problem, or water treatment i am not sure. 2) when i booked the room it was advertised as late check-out 3pm guaranteed, but it wasn't the case when i requested for the late checkout. staff insisted i check-out by 2pm, which got me frustrated due to the empty promises as made during the point of booking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My nice experience to stay in Pullman Thamrin; good location and near shopping center, it was easy to go everywhere. SANA SINI Restaurant was awesome (combination between Chinese, Japanese, Europe). What a pity! The room in Main tower was unclear; it was different with Pullman Tower. The diligence and dedication demonstrated by your bellman, named Purwono Joyo. He was exceptionally polite and elegant. We feel like home. Thank you for his extra help during this busy season. It takes a very special person to leave his important work. It was truly commendable performance. I have noticed the enthusiasm and extra hours he puts in this hotel. Will definitely come back and will recommend to my colleagues..#stayed 11st-12nd of April 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was my regular business trip to Jakarta and for this trip I decided to try Pullman at Jl Thamrin. I never look back. The hotel was immaculately clean and ambience was fantastic. I was greeted with a smile by almost every staff that I met from the cleaner to the doorman. Cleaniness was top in my preference and they did not disappoint. I will definitely use them again for my next business trip. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon my arrival, the front desk staff might have seen my Accor membership card in my hands along with my passport and my booking confirmation. The front desk staff gave me priority check-in, even if there were some other people who were checking-in at the same time with me. Upon my departure, the front desk staff also gave me priority check-out after my stay even if there were other hotel guests checking-out at the same time. The most remarkable experience about my stay was the delicious buffet breakfast I had daily for 3 mornings. Since I'm a frequent traveler and have stayed in several excellent hotels including several Accor hotels, it takes a lot to impress me. I have to admit that the breakfast at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia really impressed me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for a night..used to be nikko hotel and previously hotel president.Very nicely situated by bundaran HI, very close to a couple of big malls.The room has been renovated so it has a nice modern feel, the room is still quite small as before...but its cleaner now, the breakfast is really nice though...overall it worth the price theyre asking for
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 3 nights on a business trip. I'm already familiar with most hotels of Thamrin area but I had never stayed at this Pullman (instead I'm a loyal client of Pullman Central Park). Just wanted to check it out after renovation, in fact I picked a Grand Deluxe Room in the new wing of the hotel. Well, very good job, guys. Very stylish room, sophisticated decor and all you can ask to a business hotel: great service, good bars and, very surprisingly, a great restaurant, the Sani Sini. I was very reluctant to give it a try due to the fact that they were advertising their buffet, which comes at a bargain price of IDR 390k. It did sound to me like the usual low quality proposition of most hotels, instead I ran into a very satisfaying experience supported by great service. The whole feeling was such that I'll certainly become loyal to this Accorhotels landmark too.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're visiting central Jakarta, you can't find many better options. Save maybe the Kempinski. The property was previously the Nikko Hotel, and Japanese guests continue to flock to this location, probably because of familiarity.It's in the middle of everything. Just across the road from the Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia malls and also the welcome monument.Be aware that this is Jakarta and traffic is notoriously bad at rush hour, and you'll be right next to the busiest intersection in the country.Rooms have been designed with a modern theme and are clean and spacious, if not very inspiring.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good hotel from the minute you walk in the door. On arrival you have a personal concierge for check in and to take you to your room. I always appreciate that. Gym is excellent, pool is lovely. Breakfast selection was extremely impressive, and they have a good barrista. I had a standard Superior room which while very small was fine for my needs. I was running late when I left and they had me checked out and in a cab in about 2 - 3 minutes. Very impressive. Oh and very good WiFi. I'll stay again. Quibbles? Shower water pressure was terrible, but they can increase it for you. The bacon at breakfast was appalling. But if that's all I can find to moan about...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This property is located just in front of Grand Hyatt Hotel in Thamrin Road so the location is actually unbeatable both for business and shopping/dining, but of course because of that you could sometimes be stacked in chaotic Jakarta traffic jam. The lobby is excellent with smiling staff welcoming you and escorting to the check in operations which are brought forward in a very fast and efficient way. With a decent surcharge I was upgraded at the Grand room which provides you a separate living room with large and very comfortable sofa and a bedroom/bathroom area. The bed is extremely comfortable with plenty of pillow choices, bathroom simply perfect and large enough for all yr needs. Suggest anyhow to ask for rooms looking at the opposite side of Thamrin Road because of heavy traffic noises, beside this they are carrying on subway works day and night. As for the breakfast they should supply a map so huge is the area, excellent quality too. Allin all strongly I would strongly suggest this property.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i chose Pullman central park yesterday based on my friend recommendation and i use priviledge card.the first impression is the security in this hotel seems too much for mestaff is friendly but the scaner and checking made me neurvousmay be it is normal here but still it make me did not feel safe any more in Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My recent visit to Pullman Jakarta was really awesome and it was really memorable stay as promise by the Room Reservation Manager (Pak Eko). Would like to tae this opportunity to thank the management and the staff who have made my stay wonderfull, particularly Room Reservation Pak Eko, Chief Concierge Pa Ageng Suganto and Mr Jayakumaran (F&B). Looking forward to see you all again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 2 nights weekend break. Check in hassle free. Room seems a bit small especially in toilet. Should change the study table or relocate it as too narrow between bed & table. Swimming pool kinda dangerous as differ depth without indication. Staff very helpful in every aspect. Breakfast were spoil with too many choices from Western to Chinese food. Location average as surrounded by high end shopping malls. Nearest affordable mall Thamrin City located approx 1 km away. Hot spot for any riots as hotel located at the heart of city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman Thamrin for 3 nights and found it to be an excellent choice.Food, Facilities and the staff were all excellent. Would like to specially mention Ms.Putri of the front office who was extremely helpful and made our stay a very pleasant one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is just located opposite of a huge shopping centre with various luxury brand. The hotel has been quite some time and been rennovated recently, just a short stay and overall is ok, and to mentioned was the hotel is providing excellent breakfast, and great variety and so far the largest selection of breakfast i ever seen for my travel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here on business and simply can not fault this hotel.The staff are warm, knowledgeable, hardworking and professional. This is what service looks like.I explained to the reception clerk that I wanted somewhere to jog outdoors during my stay. His recommendation to me to get up early and join the traffic free street on Sunday morning down to Merdeka Square absolutely made my day. What a brilliant start and I would not have known about it had he not been so proactive in telling me about it. Onto the breakfast. The variety and quality is second to none. Great service and selection. You will not be disappointed. I had a superior queen and the size is on the small sized but the decor is lovely. Bathroom is separated by a transparent glass wall from the main room which may not suit some but staying alone, it was OK for me.So, all in all, I would not hesitate to stay here again and can recommend it. It has a gym and pool which I did not try. I ate in the restaurant and the buffet is sublime. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I always love Pullman Hotels. I am currently staying here but leaving tomorrow. Very nice lobby and the people working around it, starts from the greeter and reception they are all friendly and helpful. Room is nice but but too small and not a problem at all. Breakfast is super, love it. Many selection, and breakfast staff also attentive. Thank you and see you again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

During xmas period hotel was fully ocupied but was never so crowdy in lobby, bar or on the pool... Are for wellness is very nice but cozy, evening swim was just me and stars and Bintang. Oposite hotel are 2 big malls, one right oposite cross the street and second, huge one cross the street of first one. Many shops and great places for kids also. Not far to old bavaria by taxi.I cannot forget breakfast, just wow, perfect, nothing bad to say...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here a 4-nightly for a meeting in Jakarta and booked the Grand Deluxe room.Check-in was efficient and fast. Staffs were helpful and friendly. Despite the question for room upgrade related to Advantage Plus Gold/Platinum benefit (no room upgrade for the type of room we booked, since the hotel has a very limited suite rooms), the hotel managers responses were in-time. I would like to thank both Mr. Thomas Gassner and Mr. Martinus for their prompt response to clarify the question and to address the other benefit in return.Check-out was also smooth.Room was spacious yet the working desk is small for a business hotel accompanied with a non-ergonomic working chair. Chair was fine yet it doesn't look businessInternet was fast and sufficient for Jakarta standard, in both public place and room/meeting room.Dining was also excellent for any occasions. We had breakfast, dinner and cocktails at the hotel. Taxi services being provided by hotel partner was also at good service. Location and access is also at the proximity to other business hotels and 2 prominent shopping malls so it is easy for us to run and get something.Unfortunately, swimming pool was not available due to some problem during our last 3-days stay. In overall, a great stay for our business.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been stayed here for almost 5 times since 2009 every time I had my business trip in Jakarta. I'm now currently staying here (6th floor) and I can say it changed a lot. Interior renovation of hotels from lobby to room was excellent especially the elevator.Not mentioned yet the Sana Sini which is thumbs-up with a lot of variety they offer.Definitely, I will still choose to stay here on my next visit.Kudos to Pullman Hotel for making your guest feel VIPs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Jakarta is in the centre of Jakarta (if there is a "centre"!) and is a very nicely appointed business class hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathroom is spacious with a bath and shower over it. The foyer area is large, the gym is large and the pool looks nice though I didn't swim. And the breakfast buffet is extensive, covering almost all tastes and preferences.I was there for a business function which we arranged at the hotel, and the conference room was very nice, the snacks/coffee were excellent and the staff helping out were excellent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at the Pullman on Thamrin on a stopover in Jakarta and was completely satisfied with the stay. The hotel is centrally located, the room was a bit small but ok with the bathroom separated by a glaswall. We had a room to the back so noise was not an issue, but I assume that on the side to the street you will certainly hear the traffic.Breakfast in the restaurant was very good and so was the bar and the pool area. The staff was always very helpful and friendly, too. I think for the price it is a very good choose in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at this hotel while on business. The room is tiny and very noisy. Every morning I was waken up by house keeping ringing the bell along the corridor. They were also redecorating the corridor, so at 7am they very scraping down the paint from the walls outside my room. There was a constant smell of paint. I booked for 5 nights, but decided to check out earlier and go somewhere else in order to have a good night sleep.The gym is good, although is impossible to exercise in the morning due to the heat (AC was not strong enough) and with other guests walking by to access the pool.Food at the restaurant is average and overpriced. Avoid at all cost the rendang curry, the meat is really tough.When I check out I left my charger + a battery pack in the room . I since made 2 international calls and left my phone number and email and was never called back, even when assured they would. The hotel is new and in a good location, close to Grand Indonesia shopping town, but I would probably not stay there again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Booked two twin-sharing rooms and one King DeluxeSix of us stayed at the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia from 3rd to 6 April 2015.Check-in was a “breeze and smooth-sailing”. No waiting! Good job!The hotel is spacious, airy, well-decorated and fresh! I loved the simple spray of orchids that was on display everywhere!Since it was Easter, the Hotel was beautifully decorated with Easter Eggs. There’s also a beautifully white-leaves Easter tree with candied eggs and fruits. There’s also face-painting and some activities for kids.Room (Twin Superior)From the moments we entered the room, everyone was in awe. They fell in love with the room instantly especially the bathroom! My two young nieces staying next room to me, loved the room. So much so that they refused to leave the room! It’s so much better than home-sweet-home! Took lots of photos especially the bathroom! They kept on saying: “We loved the bathroom!” The towels are soft, “snow-white”, toiletries were of good standards…all in all… loved the bathroom!Room (King Deluxe)My friend (husband & wife) booked this room through Agoda.We went to “inspect” this room on the 10th floor after dinner. Yes, this is the room I will book the next time I go Jakarta. Awesome! Loved it the moment I set my eyes!BreakfastThe spread at Sana Sini Restaurant was fantastic, as always, with astonishing incredible international and local spread to perk your morning appetite. Two thumbs up!GymThe gym was fully equipped, clean and well-maintained. SpaMy friend (husband & wife) staying at Room 1003 booked one day in advance for the spa/massage. But somehow the Spa personnel screwed up the booking. The couple got quite pissed off with the mishandling of the booking, so they cancelled it. We slept well through all the nights, although some road renovations are currently on-going. I am fine with the traffic jam in Jakarta. After all that’s what Jakarta is famous for other than the floods! You just have to go with the “flow”, schedule and plan everything prior to leaving your destination, and you will be OK.I also like the car-free day on Sundays. I did my Sunday’s morning run there. My friends loved it too. It’s an “eye-opener” for a first timer in Jakarta. Amazing street activities. Awesome! I wonder whether do these people come from, when there’s no housing areas around. I guessed the one lane that was open for buses bring them the Selamat Datang Monument!I choose Pullman Jakarta Indonesia again and again, for its location, pricing, and the hotel’s state of the act facilities. Memorable, Impressive & Will Be Back Again! A very big THANK YOU for all the dedicated personnel of Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. They are always smiling, polite and attentive. From the doormen, the restaurant staff to the front-desk and everyone else... Keep Up The Good Work!

I've stayed at the nearby grand hyatt, keraton luxury collection (starwood), and the pullman is by far the best value. To be clear, i booked a grand deluxe room in the new tower so i cannot speak for the older rooms. My room was very modern, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent with a huge tub and shower. In my opinion, the room was larger and nicer than the grand hyatt, and much cleaner and in better taste and design than keraton. The pool is excellent and pretty big for laps (unlike the keraton). The spa was great - steam room, jacuzzi and sauna were modern and clean. Hotel massage was very reasonably priced and excellent. The lobby has a nice technology/business center area with free use of windows8 PCs. The restaurant and breakfast buffet is on par with other hotels. The food quality is ok, variety is excellent but i wouldn't choose to eat there if other options were convenient. The only flaw i would note is this hotel requires walking outside and over a shady bridge to access plasa indonesia (whereas keraton and hyatt are connected to the mall). But thats a small price to pay for an excellent hotel that is half the price of the hyatt and keraton. Just make sure to book a grand deluxe room in the new tower!

Pullman offers a great value five star experience in the middle of the city and right across from Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Space is a bit tight esp bathrooms as this used to be Hotel Nikko so typical Japanese hotel bathroom. Pullman have made most of the space. Only problem I found was the gym is too hot. Treadmills are located in from of windows. Otherwise good gym and the weekend brunch is outstanding 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic hotel!! My family and I stayed here for the 2nd time around.. The staff can speak and comprehend english language. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. They have a wide variety of breakfast buffet and it is strategically located at the heart and center of jakarta! All the staff were friendly and helpful too! Room service was very quick! We will definitely come back again and again to this hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Poor experience! As an Accor Silver member I was denied all benefits and rights accorded to this tier. Furthermore, I was pointedly ignored on both days during breakfast by counter staff, who rather show the Caucasians guests that come after me to the table and serve them coffee. The staff are only interested in taking my room number down and left me to my own devices. This is an extremely racist hotel! Upon feedback, there is no recourse, and all was offered was a better treatment on my next trip to the hotel! How sincere the hotel is! No way will I go back to the same hotel when they have not resolve the previous open issues!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Shoud be a nice place to stay with fully superb accomodation given. The fitness centre was great. Im truly impress with the equipment so far. All staff were too friendly and i could imagine that i was stayed in my own house. Thanks a lot to Shelby, pullman staff for her help on helping me introduce some of interest place to visit. 5 stars credit to her,staff and pullman management for your truly amazing hospitality when i was in Pullman. God bless you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was very dissapointed with their front office staffs. Had to wait for almost 2 hrs to get the available room. Parking ticket was not properly input to their system and they akses me to pay while guests are entitled for free parking ticket. But finally they let off me go without paying the fee after a long dispute.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to give 5 star ratings as an excellent hotel to stay, but after I stopped and thought about it 4 stars will be just right.Staffs were excellent, very attentive and friendly though some more English pronounciation classes for some is needed, as I sometimes had a hard time understanding them. Room was excellent and amenities were good. One thing, there are a big construction to build MRT right accross the hotel and it goes 7 days a week day and night. If you are a light sleeper, you need to have your noise cancelling head set on, or stuffed your ears. I stayed in hotels who unfortunately also have construction going on but when I checked in they told me what's expected and gave me a pair of ear plugs. But nothing was informed by this hotel. One other thing that bothered me as well is the fridge. To me and maybe 99% other world population, when we pull out a drink out of the fridge we expect a cold one. Not in this hotel. you get warm coke and beer! I asked the house keeping if the fridge was broken, and I was told it is a normal setting in the hotel. Room temperature. OOOOKKK!!! So I kept on asking for bucket of ice constantly.Let's move on,Restaurants were increadible. Breakfast was really good, you get a map to show you where everything was... so you really can imagine how big it was right?All in All I had a very pleasant stay, just the 2 above that was not up to the standards, everything else is perfect.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this property for three nights in March 2015. It met my expectations. I can't praise the staff and Management enough. They were all wonderful and walked extra mile to make it a pleasant experience for me. From Guest Experience Manager,Dina, to Tia ( in House Keeping ), Tina ( Spa Therapist) to Duty Managers ( I wish I had remembered their names ) all deserve special THANKS from my heart. Location of the Hotel is good as well and across the road one can find the Malls for shopping. Mind you Indonesia is not the place for shopping,if you are looking for buying big brand names. Next door to the Hotel is Queen's Tandoor and they had best Indian food ever eaten by myself in a restaurant. Buffet Breakfast is of good quality. Though staff need to show the guests what is where instead of just showing where to sit. I missed more then half the different items for two days due to this.Buffet dinner is awesome as well.Dinner hours need to be extended. Need bit more variety in ice cream section for sure.My next stay will be in same hotel for sure the day I go back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotels has 2 building, Main Tower and Pullman Tower.The main tower is pretty old building but well renovated by Pullman..So the room size is pretty small for deluxe room but i got feel the luxurious ambience..meanwhile if you need more size, I suggest to book the room at Pullman Tower.. King Bed Size with spacious bathroom :pHas a lot various pillow option, love it !!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed back in January, I arrived at 2 pm which was already check-in time. The receptionist said that I had to wait for an hour and she gave me a welcome drink voucher at the lounge. I waited for an hour and back to the receptionist and she said the room wasn't available yet. I wait again until 4pm and she said that the room wasn't available (again). I was mad and finally she upgraded my room to grand deluxe. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. However, the buffet breakfast was very very nice there are lot of varieties.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This place meet the standard of 4 or 5 stars (I'm not sure) hotel. It locates very near, just across the street, to the big two shopping malls. Also, Dirty Duck, a very good restaurants you have to try once. However, the hotel is located in one of the street that have a terrific problem in Jakarta. Services and all facilities were really good. There is 24-hour gym here. Sauna and pool is open till 10pm. You will see a various choice of food line in the breakfast hall including: local food, Japanese food, Chinese food, and Western food, which is very fantastic!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Standard rooms which are in the original part of the hotel are small compared to similar priced hotels in SE Asia, plus mine smelt damp and a huge dehumidifier was present in the hallway. However colleagues stayed in the new wing last year and the rooms are great I'm told and only $50 a night more expensive- worth considering. I only stayed 2 nights so the room didnt disappoint too much as other aspects of the hotel made up the experience. The buffet is sensational. Authentic food from all over Asia cooked to perfection. One colleague who travels the world non stop on business described it as the best buffet he's ever had. The bar was also great and unlike many in Asia had a non smoking area. The lobby area and boutique cafe are fantastic. For business it is in a good location as long as you are happy to take a 5 min taxi to the world trade centre area- in Jakarta traffic this like practically being next door.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman has it all. Accor has taken over the stayed Nikko and transformed it into a crisp and exciting property. They start with their mixology bar and cap the experience with the pièces de résistance; a decadent breakfast buffet. The property is centrally located which is a huge plus in a very congested metropolis. Rooms have all the amenities and the service is reminiscent of years gone by. Unreservedly recommend the experience. Enjoy!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room was so small, for a five star hotel. And it felt outdated. Even the toiletries are average, nothing luxurious. But location is nice. I had dinner there too once, and it was good and romantic overlooking one of Jakarta's busiest roads.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in both Pullman properties in Jakarta, and this one is not only my favorite in Jakarta, but also in the region. After the redesign of the lobby and rooms was done, the hotel went from nice to wow!The new rooms are beautiful, the breakfast on the ground floor is astonishing -- and as a bonus it opens at 5:30 am, due to the presence of a large contingent of Japanese business travelers (this hotel used to be a Nikko).Location wise, it's very well located downtown, which, considering the awful mess Jakarta traffic is, is a good thing. From the airport to the hotel, a taxi ride can be anything from 40mn to 2 hours.The staff is usually very friendly and helpful, but, as usual in this country, a bit slow. Pricewise, it is slightly expensive for the cost of living in Jakarta, but on par with other Pullman hotels in the region.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My sister and I stayed here for three nights before going back to the Philippines. The room was so big and very comfortable. Bathroom was really clean and there was enough space to move around. Service: Staff were definitely helpful. We asked if we could borrow tape and scissors for us to pack the souvenirs we bought in a box and they assisted us immediately. One of their staff even volunteered to tie the box for us since we have no idea how to do so. Housekeeping kept our room neat and tidy which made us feel so much at home after a long day of strolling in Jakarta.Food: The room came with breakfast good for two. My sister and I had a hard time choosing what to eat because there were a lot of choices to choose from. I personally loved the pancakes and waffle they served. Plus, they also had fruit juices and several kinds of milk. Oh, and try their paninis! Just make sure they are grilled and hot when you eat them.Pool: If you're short like me, stay at the part of the pool near the restroom. That's where the shallow part is. It was a great place to chill after a long day of sight seeing in Jakarta.Other Amenities: Pullman also has a gym and spa great for guests staying long term and have gym stuff unlike us. We didn't bring any of that so we weren't able to try.Convenience: Plaza Indonesia is just located right in front of the hotel.Overall, it was such a great hotel. And I'm definitely staying there when I go back to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

located in the heart of Jakarta, Pullman let me to easily enjoying Jakarta. Just cross the road to walk the huge malls ... not so far from Monas and Old-town and I did it midnight by a motorbike (with a local friend of course, I can't ride motorbike myself haha)....Overall the hotel is superb! Nice stay and so convenient!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

this hotel have a very good location which is very near with 2 great shopping mall in Jakarta. The staff and the room was nice, but it still just hotel room, nothing special about the room for me. The thing i liked about this hotel was the food, either breakfast or dinner. The food was great speciallt for dinner, they provide western food, italian food, chinese food, japanese food, and indonesian food. Which is very unique because there're no other hotels in Jakarta that gives you these much variety for dinner (i've tried a lot of hotels restaurant). For business traveller, i recommend this hotel because of the location, facilities, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pefectly located in central Jakarta, we stayed in the New Executive Suite, beautiful 86m2 of luxury, freetanding bath, guest toilet, huge lounge room, huge bedroom, lovely bathroom with separate toilet, WIRobe. Free minibar, work station. Free laundry each day, free cocktail and Tapas each day. Stroll to Indonesia plaza and Grand Plaza. Breakfast choice amazing, food stations from all around the world Staff attentive and friendly, Miss Shelby guest relation awesome, This is an excellent hotel whether for business or pleasure. We will certainly stay here again next time we are in Jakarta. Cannot recommend this hotel higly enough. Thankyou Pullman Hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman is really a great stay, just across from the biggest shopping malls in Jakarta and plenty of dining options around both local and international! The room I stayed in was decent, bed very good, bathroom alright and maybe a bit small, but acceptable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location, nice rooms in the extension wing, Kemistry bar is nice alternative to the crowded joints with the advantage of not having to brave the Jakarta traffic, great breakfast selection... my hotel of choice in Jakarta... enough said!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:Smack in the city center, Pullman is one of 4 upscale hotel around Bundaran HI, which is the center of business gravity of Jakarta. You basically can walk to many office towers along Thamrin Road and Sudirman Road. Pullman's location is also just 5 minutes walk (and over a pedestrian bridge) to not 1 but 2 of the best shopping centers in Jakarta, the Plaza Indonesia (adjacent to the Grand Hyatt Hotel) and Grand Indonesia (adjacent to the Hotel Indonesia Kempinski).The RoomMy wife and I stayed at a Grand Deluxe room on the 14th floor (their highest is 15th, being renovated when we were there), overlooking the Thamrin Road and you still can see the Bundaran Hi. We love the room, it is spacious, the bed is great, and the bathroom has a stand-alone bathtub and two separate cubicles with doors for the toilet and shower. Also provided in the room is the foldable ironing table, an umbrella and a safe. On the wall by the workdesk you have an interface panel so you can connect your laptop to the TV either using a VGA or HMDI or even an RCA cable! You also have a real coffee brewer and old-fashioned tea maker (with tea leaves) in the room!The Buffet Breakfast (and also Lunch)We dined 3 times at the Sana Sini Restaurant (on the lobby floor) and it was a total pampering! They serve 4 cuisines (Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese and Western) and you end up running out of space in your stomach before having tried everything. In my opinion, the most difficult to cook is Indonesian cuisine and they do a great job with that. The difference between buffet breakfast and buffet lunch is simply they have more food to offer for lunch with the lunch roughly only $3 more expensive. For lunch, we first wanted an ala carte menu, but then after seeing you can eat the whole restaurant for the price of 1 ala carte menu, we opted for the buffet.WellnessThe Pullman hotel also offers a wellness center with a medium sized pool, a gym and a spa. 4 days a week they also offer a variety of exercises.The ServiceWe love the service! The staff was friendly and helpful. One morning I requested our room to be cleaned earlier than their standard time, and they friendly obliged. When my wife wanted to use the coffee brewer, but since there was no user manual available, we called the service center and they sent someone to assist and teach how to use it.DisturbanceOn the Thamrin Road they are working day and night on the MRT Project. If you are on 10th floor or above the noise level is OK. To my surprise, this project has quite low noise level to other similar projects I encountered in Indonesia. Another issue is the renovation project on the 15th floor (they stopped working around 5pm), that is much more noisier than the MRT project. But, that's the known risk for saying on the floor beneath :-).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a member of accor advantage plus and have stayed at the hotel for at least a couple of occasions. My last stay was from 6-8 Mar. Everything was expected of a 5 star hotel except for the checking out process. The hotel did not have a clearly marked Q system that led to an unpleasant situation. I was queueing in line behind a counter with a another guest in front of me. As I step up for my turn I was told that a lady from another Q line was to be served first. I was confused as there wasn't any clear markings where to Q. Although I was attended to after I questioned about the Q system, I thought the episode was absolutely unnecessary. Front office need to decide whether there is a single or multi line Q system and mark it clearly. As I saw it, the hotel had perhaps intended a single Q system where guests will be attended to on a First Come First Served Basis but this wasn't made clear resulting in guests queueing in multi lines and 'jumping' Q.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well I can say you really got anything you need in this hotel, as Im the regular customer and i stayed here every month for business or even just stay over weekend in jakarta. Very nice gym center, big swimming pool, decent sauna and jacuzzi, also massage n spa is all u need during stay in this hotel. Well its even better since im a platinum member of accor and again, they have a high standard of hospitality.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a great stay recently and I would particularly like to praise the attitude of the staff. Troy & Jhonatan from the concierge team were of particular assistance when my luggage was lost by Malaysian Airlines.The hotel is very cenrtral. Rooms in the old wing are yet to be renovated and are a little worn. I would suggest paying the small upgrade fee for a room in the new wing.I will stay here again if I am in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a member of Advantage Plus. I used the complimentary night and upgrade it for a small fee to the grand deluxe room (renovated room, 43 sqm). -The room was very nice and comfortable.-The staff (especially Ms Bunga) were very helpul and friendly. She gave us the room (on higher floor) face to EX, Grand Hyatt, Kempinski...very good view...and Ms Bunga allowed us to check out the latest at 2pm...-After Mr Dwi (IT officer) help me, the wifi is so good and fast. -Menu of breakfast are good....I would like to stay here again and I would recommend it to my friends and family.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed a week here for business. Wonderful staff, outstanding facilities. Gym and pool area are top notch, breakfast buffet is amazing with 7 different theme food areas! Wonderful little bar although it can get a little smoke filled at times. Take the skywalk across the street for great shopping mall and restaurant dining options. Overall a wonderful stay and I would choose it again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at The Pullman Jakarta on 1 to 5 Feb 2015, on a business trip. I have been coming back to this hotel for a few years now, even when it was called Nikko Hotel.The Good:1. Fully equipped gym and a half-size pool - suitable for a good workout, and a soak in the jacuzzi.2. Awesome breakfast - they offer the Indonesian Jamu drinks, local dishes, Japanese, Continental breakfast. Full lavish spread - spoiled for choice!3. Good location as the malls are just across the road - only Grand Hyatt and Kempinski are better as they are linked to the malls.4. Renovated hotel rooms are relatively new - a big improvement from Nikko's small cramped rooms.5. Pleasant surprises - For example, during the Christmas season, in Dec 2014, they even had a large team of carolers singing at the lobby, and even a Santa Claus! It was completely unnecessary, but kudos to the hotel management for that great effort.6. Small room, but well equipped with the basic amenities - no issues there as I was on business, and I don't really need very much.The Bad:1. Checking in and out - front desk staff are very slow, and their documentation seems disorganised sometimes, and they seem to run about trying to find files and papers that are all over the counter. Be patient - its normal.2. The area sometimes is prone to demonstrations, which usually happens in the Bundaran area, which can affect traffic considerably.3. The malls are on the OTHER SIDE of the road, where Grand Hyatt and Kempinski are. But it would take you about 7 mins to walk to across the bridge to the malls, so I suppose it isn't too bad.4. Biggest issue about the room: The walls and doors are thin - I can hear people walking outside my room and sometimes a door slams hard, very loudly and you can hear it quite plainly. Conclusion:Its a good enough hotel for business, and it is good value for money hotel with full features. But if Grand Hyatt or Kempinski offers the same rate, I would certainly switch over and stay with them instead.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

it was a good hotel, booked it as a gift to my parents, however even when they reached late (due to flight delays) the room was not prepared. however that delay can be overlooked for the type of service they received over the next two days. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

STAYED THERE FOR 3 NIGHTS...WORST STAY EVER.Do not give credit cards. They charge you extra without your approval.Service was bad.... all about money and tipsFood was not fresh.... could hardly eat anything and expensive for areaThe hotel is the old Nikko Hotel .... rooms are old and dated ... limited water in showerNEEDS MAJOR RENOVATION... DISHONEST MANAGEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been staying in Pullman Jakarta for more than year now…gradually the services has improved.Special credit to Miss Dina Tumbulan from Sales and Mr Jeya Kumar (F & B Manager).The Sana Seni restaurant staffs as well…they've really improved under the guidance of Mr Jeya…Bravo..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a frequent traveler, the most crucial thing is the service. No matter how good the hotel is but if the service is bad, i will never return for the second time. It was my first time at Pullman Thamrin, Jakarta when we were welcomed by Badriah, during my check in with my toddlers, Badriah was very kind, sweet and helpful, she was playful with my daughters and help me to look after my children when i was checking in. My first impression was wow, never happened in any other hotels around the world. Thank you for making our stay memorable. The superior room was small, i would suggest for travelers who come with a child to upgrade their room at least to deluxe room for your convenient (i will definitely do that on my next visit), everything else was perfect.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was been here with my husband.We only stay for one night in here, the room are too small for us, but clean.The excellent things we found out are the breakfast - they have really a wide selections for the breakfast! I never seen such a hotel serves you with a lot of choices like that for the breakfast - and the food are tastes good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the exterior seems a little dated, the rooms are excellent. They are well equipped, clean and very comfortable. The location is very good for business. Near all the major business areas and malls.This hotel probably has the best breakfast I've come across. The fast free wifi is a good touch
-------------------------------------------------------------------

had the opportunity to book 2 nights stay superior room on january with very best affordable price when accor held promotion for its member on last november. Overall, as this hotel is located exactly on the heart of the city, we can reach any interesting places easily. Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia just acrossed the street. It also offered good facilities, good room condition and best staff hospitality. And my favourite one during my stay, I found huge variety of foods served on breakfast and all tastes good. :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everytime I am in Jakarta either for business or leisure, I make a point to tah in Pullman hotel Thamrin mostly because of its location being right in the middle of the city. There are two big shopping malls within walking distance; Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Although there are other hotels within its vicinity (Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, Kempinski and Keraton) comparing the room rates, Pullman hotel Thamrin is much cheaper! After the renovation which includes the new wing, the rooms are very nice and cosy.I have no other comment for its staff except that they are really warmth and friendly. Any request that I have made, were attended to professionally.The food is great especially at the restaurant be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Its a well spread cuisine consisting of local, Chinese, Japanese and Western delicacies.I would fully recommend Pullman Botel Thamrin to anybody wanting to visit Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 2 nights while in Jakarta. The staffs were so friendly and helpful. Any questions just ask and they always seem happy to help. Rian Reception welcoming me warmly and help me very much. The room was very comfortable the hotel facilities were great! Free water and nice clean room. Really enjoyed my stay and would stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for 5 days in October 2014, the rooms are very small and pretty average as far as amenities are concerned.The staff is helpful however they did mix up our bills and quoted wrong amounts as we were a big group staying at the hotel.The breakfast is the highlight of this hotel and is fabulous with all varieties available in all cuisines like English, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, etc.Location is central
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we visited few years back, we come back and the hotel is fully renovated. More premium look and premium services. The staff also very helpul but I think some regulation for numbers of people to swim from one room max 4 persons (doesn't matter are they adult or kids under 12 yro) quiet makes us unhappy. We came 5 persons (me-adult and 4 kids under 12), so I let the 4 of them to swim while I have to sit on the chair monitoring them. In any others Accor's group hotel I didn't find this kind of regulation. Anyway we enjoying staying here, unfortunately we can't play outside during sunday "car free day' morning because of rain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried both Pullman hotels in Jakarta. This one in Thamrin is much better. The room seems bigger. It is also located right at the centre of business area in Jakarta.I had good experience with customer service as well. The receptionist asked about my transport and helped arrange my transport to my meeting. It should be a common courtesy but not all hotels do offer to help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was pleased with your services. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I want to commend you for your fine bellman, named Purwono Joyo. I want you to know how impressed I'm with the professional manner bellman in which he handled me. I just want to tell you how much I appreciate the services work he do for me. I salute you for your professional approach and are proud to enjoy you as part. thank you for your out standing service. Accept my gratitude for your bellman, he do the job well done. Keep up the good work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything goes well, definitely will stay there again.Staffs were helpful, check in and out is smooth Hotels facilities is good, we have a good massage in the spa.Hope other pullman were up to this    
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my favorite hotel when staying in Jakarta. I've been using so many different brands of hotel in the past but none could satisfy me like Pullman Thamrin Jakarta. Used Deluxe room on the 11th level of the main building, the room was spacious, the bathroom was spacious too with all sorts of amenities that various guest will need.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

we wanted to find a nice hotel in a good location without paying top dollar. This exceeded our expectations for four nights. Location is central, and walking distance to two very large and popular malls. Breakfast and cafe options were great. Rooms were on the smaller side, but neat, functional, and modern. Would stay here again and not hesitate to choose it over the much more expensive options across the street (Mandarin Oriental, Grand Hyatt) or in other parts of the city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing much to say - as a picky business traveller I cannot find any floss of this hotel. Every time great service, nice rooms - spacious, quiet, feel of great comfort, excellent breakfast with lots of fresh choices, very nice staff, fast internet and nice facilities in a central location - what else you need? All my customers also appreciate the hotel and I think it's really a good and comfortable place to have business meetings and discussions! Thank you!! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Jakarta is the cheapest of the Bundaran's big four but what it concedes in price it more than makes up for in style and elegance. The amenities are top notch as is the customer service. But what I liked most is the lack of pretension. Unlike its stuffy local competitors, you don't have to be the CEO of a Bay area start up to be treated like one. Here every one is valued, including families which there were plenty of. In fact, on Sunday afternoon they set up a jumping castle and rides in the lobby for the little ones. As I said, there's something for everyone at the Pullman. The gym is amazing and the pool is big enough to swim laps.I stayed in a delux (1016) which had separate a living and bedroom. It would be perfect for those with young kids. I chose the delux because it is the only class of room that comes with a coffee machine. Being a caffeine junkie it meant more to me than extra space but be warned it's a brand I'd not seen before and the coffee was not the best. But if that's the only low beat in an otherwise sumptuous orchestra, you know you're doing ok. If you're in Jakarta for work or for pleasure, you can't beat the Pullman for cost and quality. I can't wait to return. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well located. Probably the most important when booking in indonesia for me.A almost 5* hotel.Smaller rooms than you would expect. food in hotel was ok+, including room service.Big busy hotel, if you don't like that go other places.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location was excellent, surrounding with malls thus a good location to shops.. Our room was spacious modern design room and they have very superb breakfast. Checking in was fast and friendly receptionists are polite too. Security was tight which is good for guest's peace of mind.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman was wonderful! Nice room, EXCELLENT breakfast buffet, massage was great. Pool nice and relaxing. Staff was there for our EVERY need. DO STAY at the Pullman. The location is central to anything you need
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an extremely comfortable hotel. My room was spacious and given comments but others it is would be worth requesting a larger room at checkin. Unlike some hotels the lighting in the room was good, with switches and power pints where you need them. The desk was comfortable and the bed exceptionally so. The tea selection in the bedroom is the best I've come across in a long time. Ordering tea in the bar resulted in a pot each of real tea in a pot. Most refreshing at the end of a long day of traffic and travel. The staff are friendly and helpful.There is an enormous choice for breakfast; vegetable quiche makes a change from the usual.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Delightful variety superb breakfast. Super polite staffs. Good location to shops. Modern comfy elegant room (love our room so much). Security seems tight (good for peace of mind, bad if you need to keep going in and out of the hotel though)Overall it is a very worth stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We loved our stay here. From the moment we entered the hotel we felt we were welcome and being looked after. The room was very comfortable and always kept exceptionally clean. The restaurant was very special providing 5 different nationality areas. A massive choice of food freshly cooked food (including vegetarian) with knowledgeable chefs describing dishes you did not recognise. Breakfast was similarly inspiring. There is a very comfortable bar area and a very nice continental style cafe if you just need to relax over a drink and a snack. The swimming pool area was excellently kept and we used this every day. The hotel is in close proximity to some excellent and extensive shopping/cafe/restaurant malls and it is easy enough to walk to some more traditional areas as well. Trams stop opposite the hotel if you want to visit Kota. We think all the staff were working hard to make our stay pleasant but we would really single out all the restaurant staff for their efforts. We would stay here again and we would recommend it to friends and family.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was here last year for work and stayed for a period of 3 days....The hotel itself is modern and neat, and as for the rooms, although they were a bit on the small side, was really cosy and comfy. Love the bathtub with a view of the TV in the main part of the roomService was okay...not the warmest, but they did enough to make sure things got processed and we got our rooms checked in and out okay. Love the breakfast range here. It may not be as luxurious as Shangri La, but they have a decent spread and quality of food is pretty at all.Location-wise, we had to use the overhead bridge a lot to access the malls and other places around the area. If you don't mind the climb, then it shouldn't be a huge issue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This time i stay with my husband and we celebrate new year at sana sini restaurant. I stay very often at Pullman Thamrin because of the location and the food at sana sini restaurant. This time we have outstanding new year dinner buffet, also a good ala carte menu on 3th of January, but the service wasnt good. the waiter (i will not mentioned his name) was not really helpfull and 2 of my friends should wait half an hour for the drink.I have to wait pretty long for sugar. so pity.. Its actually pretty good restaurant with authentic indonesian food and many variety food, their just have to increase the service and maybe engaging a good service-training? The design of restaurant is nice and i like to sit there for dining.The room is quite nice, i love the view of Thamrin street (otherwise i wont stay there) and the lobby is very inviting. Its just a bit dissapoiting that its so noisy and so we cannot sleep long. 8 am, early in the morning they start hammering and sawing and drilling, soooo loud as if its just next door! 8 am!! i complain to the reception, to operator, to concierge.. its just impossible.. how can Pullman give us a high new year room price without appropriate comfort? there is no explanation about building renovation or something, and what i booked is the newly renovated room, brand new grand-delux, with higher price than "normal" room. the hotel has many nice places to chill, i also like le chocolate bar.Nice reception, fast check in and check out, nice smile, good handling complain, i just wishing they could do more helping guest (reacting when guest need something or complaining something)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great location & polite staff. Room is small in size but it doesn't really bother me as I had a good night sleep. The bed was very comfortable. Location is central, 5 minutes walk to Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia. Also very near to Sarinah shopping centre for batik and souvenir shopping. Highly recommended!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am happy writing review of this hotel again. Seems, they always learn how to improve its services though there are some missing things still found.I checked-in in the late afternoon, room was ready, and as platinum member i was so lucky to know that my room was upgrade to higher room category. my luck continued when i was given card that mentioned my benefit as a platinum member. benefits are as follows:- all day refreshment of coffee, tea, juice, soft drink at Le Chocolat- Drink and Tapas Priviledge at Kemixtri Gastro Bar- Complimentary Buffet BreakfastDeluxe Room:Room Number 601 has a different layout compared to other Deluxe room. Difference; There are dining table, kitchenette with proper utensil for cooking, and bigger fridge, bathroom area which is smaller. Although bathroom is smaller and overall of room size a bit smaller, i prefer this room since there is dining table and kithcenette. it such as a studio room instead of deluxe room.I found, they provide new toiletries. CoBigelow products instead of Roger and Gallet. Hotel informations were well packaged in book. Other services such as pillow menu, ironing board were there. Internet connection was very fast and stable.Newspaper requested before arrival was ready and the next day they also sent it. Welcome fruit (3 green apples) and 2 chocolates were served, and to be honest i prefer to have welcome cake like my previous stay, it looked better. Moreover, no welcome gift was given, maybe they has thrown this service for Accor Platinum member. However, first time ever, i was delivered letter greeting from GM, FOM, Hotel Manager. it such a good treatment and very unexpectedStaff:Very polite, friendly, and helpful. good credit to Sri (if not wrong), staff from Kemixtri who handle my arrival.Breakfast and Tapas Priviledge:There were 3 choice of tapas menu, and it was free of charge (each worth IDR 90,000). Good plating and nice taste as well. I just need to sign what i order.New breakfast experience at Sana Sini Restaurant. much more better than previous breakfast you ever had at 2nd floor. This was the best buffet breakfast at accor hotel and even your breakfast was better than Sofitel Bali.Abundant selection of food started from bakery and pastry station, selection of sweet cakes and dessert, selection of fresh fruits, selection of juice, japan dishes station, dimsum selection, selection of traditional indonesian drink and snack such as Jamu and Bajigur, curry dishes, Asian food station, noodle station, selection of cheese, western dishes station. All were freshly served.Dislike:Please open the main entrance gate instead of entrance gate located in side and back of the hotel. it is dropped the value of your hotel.Tips:Whoever bring car to hotel, i would recommend to park car in Annex building. it has a direct access to the hotel from parking area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall the rooms are average for a 5 star hotel. Fairly small and on the older side, but very clean nonetheless. On a positive note, staff very friendly, location excellent and the breakfast buffet was very good.All in all very good hotel as rates are about half the surrounding hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I come to sana sini restaurant at least 3 times in a week, but never tried d brunch buffet until today. It was great, seafood were fresh, they had fresh lobster and oyster ... the staffs were amazing, especially Tiara. She was very nice, friendly, polite and very helpful ... could not get name of other staffs but they were all very helpful, except for d guy at pasta station / grilled station. When i asked about spaghetti, he starred at me and ignored me then after i waited for him then only he asked me "what is it you want again?" i found that very rude. When i took an oyster at seafood station, i asked the lady if they can grill it with garlic she said YES, just ask the guy over there. So i went to see the same guy again at pasta station, when i asked him, he starred at me said we don't do that here, he seems to be pissed of me asking him that. It was a small favor, won't take 3 minutes of his time, i won't even bother to ask if the lady at seafood station say no. I told him, the lady said to bring it here and normally they could do that even in Mulia and Shangrila, he said yes but we don't do that here. We are not the same. Well, I think he meant to say he was not even the same with any other staff. Even though he kinda ruined my day, but thanks to other well trained staffs, i was able to enjoy my time there. Hopefully someone / manager will train him how to be polite with customer. My overall review, food are great, service are great, price is more expensive during brunch but it was worth it. One of my favorite restaurant 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It a great nice and clean hotel right next to 2 of the biggest shopping center in Jakarta. The location is right at the middle of Jakarta and very easy to get around. You can reach most places within 30 minutes. The hotel staffs are very helpful too.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed there for two nights. The check-in process was fast, very friendly frontdesk officer. The rooms were neat and tidy. Had a welcome note and fruits in the room. The bed was very comfy and big. The bathroom comes with a shower bathtub and heater. The only part that I don't fancy was the wardrobe and it's kinda small. Other than that, we love everything else and the view from our room. As it is strategically located in the Central of Jakarta, it is accessible to almost anywhere. The breakfast spread was the best I've ever experience. It's more like a lunch buffet, which covers almost everything a guest want. Would love to give compliment to Mr Reza from the banquet for his extraordinary customer service. I can honestly see his professionalism and passion towards his work and interaction with the guests. He is an asset to the hotel. My family and I had a wonderful experience staying in Pullman Jakarta and definitely it's not going to be the last. I would recommend this hotel for everyone either for business or leisure. I think they are going through some renovation on the pool level but it is still open for guest to soak themselves after a long day under the hot sun.Unfortunately of my family member got bitten by a insect when she woke up the next morning but luckily I had my first-aid kit so everything when well. Not sure if its from the hotel bed or some random insect managed to get it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I travelled to Jakarta to visit friends last weekend and stayed at the Pullman Jakarta. Centrally located and very conveniently proximate to two well appointed shopping malls, the Pullman was a good and well-priced choice.The standard of the room I booked via expedia was solid, albeit a bit cramped. Service throughout the stay was of a very high standard as was the quality of the food, including buffet breakfast and room service. Perhaps the highlight for me was the well-equipped gymnasium and the really pleasant rooftop pool, which managed to catch all of the afternoon sun. Delightful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Having stayed at this particular hotel on numerous occasions I feel it's necessary to finally review it!It's location is perfect, in the heart of Central Jakarta and within walking distance of Plaza&Grand Indonesia.The staff are polite&attentive and the rooms are well maintained.The artisanal array of coffee&tea choices along with the delicious desserts at 'Le Chocolat' are a must try!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for 2 nights for business. Experienced very friendly and smooth check in and out, although it was midnight arrival and early morning departure. The restaurant opens from 5:30 am for the early departure, however the food and bevarage was not ready at the opening time. Hope it will be improved. Compare to other 5 starts hotels in Jakarta it is a best hotel in terms of Location, Service and Price. Highly recommend to business traveller.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Hotel at Thamrin Road is one of my best choice in center of Jakarta. First of all you will meet and feel the friendliness atmosphere from the hotel staff. It is the best spot in leisure and also as as well as executing business. The 24 hours security around the hotel premises is well established. It really worth for what I spend in this luxury hotel. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Checked in early for one night during a recent business trip in this hotel. Although my early checkin requested, unfortunately my room type request was not available. Then again, between an early checkin and my preferred room type, I will take the early checkin anytime.The room I was allocated was more than adequate. Apart from having some challenges connecting to the Internet which was quickly resolved by their IT support, everything was in order.Breakfast was excellent with a very wide choice. Could have stayed longer to sample the other delights but unfortunately I have an early meeting and did not give myself sufficient time for a leisurely breakfast. My bad......With both Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia a stones throw away, dining options need not be restricted to the offerings available in the hotel.Would certainly come back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent service, wonderful staffs and breakfast is simply amazing. Within walking distance to great malls in Jakarta. Will definitely come back.Rooms are a little bit small but it's big enough for two person. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My family was celebrated new year eve at pullman hotel...it was very nice experience and my child was very happy too..cause he was swimming all day..and i can relax with steam and sauna..and the food was so good theres asian and europian and indonesian food..the room so nice, clean and nice design..the view was nice we can see central of the city jakarta..will be back asap.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This pullman hotel is located near Indonesia mall and close to many other high end 5 star hotels. If you don't know much about Jakarta or the city center this would be a good start.However location comes at a price. The hotel and restaurants are not really cheap. And the normal rooms are quite small with a really small bathroom and bath tub. Personally I was not impressed by the room at all. Breakfast is good with such a wide variety of food, make sure you make a booking with breakfast included. Pullman is famous for bed and pillows, but be aware that they only have very big pillows. If you don't like this they can not provide smaller ones.Staff is friendly and helpfull, the reception works fast and efficient. OveralI I think the price/quality ratio is a little bit lost for room size.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I will start by the positives...best location, attractive contemporary design and very comfortable rooms, delicious breakfast. But the same cannnot be said of the upkeep and the problem resolution! We stayed (family with 2 young children) in this hotel at the beginning of the month and we have been faced with several issues that have affected our stay. First construction works on the 3 rd floor - hammering / drilling - I had to call 4 times, go to the reception twice and even on the construction site to get the workers to stop their works to let us sleep. No alternative accommodation proposed, no words of excuse, not even a fruit or cake to compensate. Second : the hot water poured in thee bathtab was dirty brown, so we could not bath the kids. Third : the AC was not working one afternoon and to sum up at check out my credit card was charged 3 times for the same amount and I am now waiting for my bank to cancel the transactions! The guests contact team seems not to be empowered to solve issues...I was compensated with a U$ 6 ride to the nearby station. It is sad that such a well located and comfortable hotel is plagued with so many technical issues and that there is no process in place to recover unsatisfied customers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't fault this hotel. Great location, staff, beautiful and quite rooms. Tasty breakfast with enormous variety, superb cocktails and both of the bars and very attentive staff. Also very nice outdoor pool if you want to soak up some sun.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel lies in the heart of Jakarta, close to restaurants and shopping malls, which can all be reached within 5 minutes. The rom was modern, big and clean. My room was located on the backside, facing away from the street, so I heared no noises from the traffic.The staff was very polite, nice and extremely helpful. My luggage got lost the Soekarno-Hatta Airport and the lady at the lost luggage office was not very helpfull due to her limited english. The hotel sent over a driver to pick me up and to talk to the lady. After everything was clear they asured me to take care about my luggage and they did. The concierge caaled me in the late evening that they got a feedback from airport. It fell of the conveyor belt and they will send someone to pick it up and bring it to my room. So finally I got my luggage back.Great service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in quite a number of hotels in Jakarta including Marriot, Ritz, Grand Hyatt, Sheraton, Manhattan, etc and this was my first time in Pullman Jakarta and I must say it was a wonderful experience. I stayed for 2 nights in the new wing to attend my BFF wedding over the weekend. The check-in process was a breeze and the rooms were superb. Room design was top-notch and I must say the bed was one of the best I have ever laid on. The room was very clean and toilet facilities were excellent. Décor and lighting was very good. Although we didn't really have a view but it mattered little as the hotel was conveniently located near 2 of the biggest shopping malls in Jakarta - Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. We traveled just before the Xmas weekend and the hotel décor was suitably done up to reflect the seasonal flavors. (Although I would still say Grand Hyatt still tops the Xmas décor department with their humongous Xmas tree). Breakfast spread was very good with lots of variety - local, Japanese, Korean, western, etc and food quality was quite good. I definitely would consider Pullman as one of my top hotel choices in my next trip to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had an excellent stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, so comfortable and great to visit the city, at a good price.Positive :- good location, easy to visit all major interesting places of Jakarta- excellent service during all our stay- very comfortable rooms, the transparent wall between bathroom and room is great- really good restaurant- exceptional breakfast, the richest in variety of all hotels we have seen worldwide (we have seen a lot)To be improved :- not much, everything was perfect
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some hotels which are just perfect in everything, this is one of them.Great Location - Besides some Malls and in City CentreGood WifiGreat Breakfast and the Dinner Buffet was fantastic!Good sized rooms and well maintainedIn all perfect! One Jakarta Advice - If your looking to go short distance don't ask the hotel to book the cheaper Blue cab as their minimum fare is 40,000 for bookings on phone. So the luxury car will turn out to be much cheaper.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have sampled many hotels in Jakarta trying to find the right one for my monthly visits, I had been at the Pullman before and liked it but decided this trip to try one more hotel just to see, big mistake checked out after 1 night and made a last minute booking at the Pullman, it was like just coming home actually. The new area downstairs really is fantastic and I could not believe the difference from when I stayed two years ago when it was only a tunnel through to the lift and up to the next floor for check-in and breakfast. The ambience in the lobby is ideal and even as a business traveler you feel at home and completely relaxed by the set up. The staff are a total credit to the hotel, each and every one of them were warm, welcoming and incredible focused to ensure that the best service was given at all times. The breakfast was the best I have had in a city centre hotel, it really could not be faulted, from the perfectly made eggs to the many choices of juices and ways to have my coffee, I could have sat there all day just enjoying what was on offer. All the staff were just the very best but if I could mention one lady who went even further and had such a great attitude towards customer service and nothing was too much trouble, so please pass on my thanks to Suci on the lobby floor. The moment you see her smile and kind nature you feel relaxed and assured that everything is in hand, so well done to the Pullman and very well done to Suci and the rest of the team. I have decided that the Pullman will be my hotel of choice for my regular visits to Jakarta and after sampling a few hotels in Jakarta trying to really decide the best hotel for me it is clear that the absolute number one choice is the Pullman and the others do not even come close. Plus they serve the very best old fashioned hot chocolate in Indonesia if not in APC….
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in two room suite. Great room with comfortable bed. Excellent service and fantastic food. My only complaint is that one of the Sana Sini restaurant staff appeared to be sick as he was serving us. Other than that our stay was excellent. We will definitely be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a wonderful stay at pullman thamrin. Everything was awesome, very spacious room with great rate. I don't think there are other hotels in this location with wonderful view of bunderan HI can beat pullman thamrin's room rate. I stayed in deluxe room, old tower but they were nicely renovated, so it was lovely. The deluxe room have a small living room, bathroom with tub, 2 televisions, espresso machines, plenty of complimentary mineral water, nice amenities, oh did i mention it had a small walking closet? Love it.!The only thing that concern me is the floor at the shower room, it gets slippery when it's wet, be careful if you stay with smaller children.Like other reviewers said, don't ever skip the breakfast, massive choice of western and asian menu, friendly staffs at the restaurant, make sure you make your reservation with breakfast in it.The conclusion is i will definitely go back to this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for a night at the Pullman Jakarta and was delighted by the room size, cleanliness, the decor and the general upkeep of the entire property! Great location and impeccable service staff right from the doorman to the front office to the F&B staff, one of the best in class! The only thing I felt a lack in was the menu on the breakfast, it did not have too many choices for a western palate...but hey, let that not be a deciding factor, because the hotel is excellent in all other respects...! Being a business traveller, I could not ask for more; I would definitely stay again !Please thank your service staff for an excellent display of courtesy and assistance to the guests!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed here countless times for business trip as we have company rate with the hotel. My experiences have been a hit or miss, although it got better after it was transformed into Pullman. Most of my complaints are mostly related to the heavy smoker guests they have. When it was Nikko hotel, there were 2 times that they booked me into a smoking room despite my requests for non smoking room. They were not able to change room for me as they were fully booked. Another time they put me into non-smoking room but there was very strong cigarette smoke in the room and the lock at the door was broken. Again they had no other rooms available. Note that the hotel is quite popular especially among Japanese. I made complaints twice and they were apologetic about it and offered a free night at executive suite for me (woohoo!!). The room was huge and decent with big bath. I mostly enjoy the breakfast buffet here which was just delicious and of good quality with many fresh fruit and selections (they offered Japanese breakfast as well). They also have outdoor swimming pool which i used a few time along with the gym. Besides the smoking smell, I would have loved this hotel fine. It is also right across from all the big fancy malls and restaurants and is in a very good and safe area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We didn't plan to stay here: the taxi driver took us to the wrong pullman hotel, but after being stuck in the notorious Jakarta traffic and seeing it was right across from the restaurant we had booked for dinner, we decided to stay and cancelled our reservation at the other Pullman hotel. Dede at reception was very helpful with our last minute reservation and handled our confusion professionally. She warned us the superior room was only 21sqm but as we live in HK, that's spacious for us! The room is designed well, plenty of space with a work desk and nice couch. The bed is comfortable with a good pillow menu. As this is a former hotel nikko, the bathroom had a bath and the fittings are Japanese. Like many hotels these days, you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom but the blinds can be used to block the view into the bathroom. Windows were double glazed, so we didn't hear much street noise, so we slept well. Room service was good and quick. Indonesian favourites as well as the usual western and also Japanese options. They rectified their error of including meat in the mie jawa quickly and courteously.Breakfast is fabulous! Special thanks to Reza for his friendly service and for introducing us to some Indonesian delights. Great selection of western, Japanese, Chinese and of course Indonesian options.Hotel location is excellent. Right across from Plaza Indonesia, and in the future it looks like there will be an MRT station right across, too.Very glad we stayed here, in spite of the initial confusion! Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 2 nights over the weekend at the Pullman. Much has been mentioned about its excellent location, and I gladly second that. Everything else is also very good: I got a room on the 9th floor facing Thamrin Street, and it offered me a great view without much of the traffic noise that I had been concerned about. The swimming pool area and gym are very pleasant. Sauna, steamroom and especially the jacuzzi are first rate. The staff are professional, and some very friendly. All in all, as my title stay, my 2 night stay at the Pullman seemed to go by very quickly. I will absolutely stay here again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After taking over from Niko chain, this hotel has awaken from its slumber and sleazy notion. The room is clean and had enough lighting especially in the new wings. The restaurant had the rotated theme, from Asian to European, which is good. it also has TWG saloon in its lounge. Still attracts many loyal Japanese clientele.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the Pullman, Jakarta. This was my first stay in this hotel and the experience was excellent. The staffs were exceptional and were only too happy to help when requested. Furthermore the breakfast buffet was very good and the restaurant opened at 05:30am which is great when you have to go to meetings at 06:30am.I will ceratinly return to the Jakarta Pullman Hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay in the Pullman regularly, and will continue to do so. It has an excellent location between the old city and the business districts to the south. The hotel's renovation a couple of years ago left it with modern rooms and good facilities (but the corridor smelled a tad musty and clearly the humid climate is doing damage.) The restaurant was good with an excellent buffet selection for breakfast. Room service was quick and efficient and the food good. The main problem I had was the wifi system. As far as I could tell (trying on multiple days with multiple devices) the login server for the hotel wifi didn't work at all. Could not access the network at all from my room. By contrast the open access (no login) network in the lobby and restaurant worked great. I will stay here again for sure, but hope they can fix the wifi problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a frequent traveller the Pullman Jakarta had the best facilities and service I have seen in a long time. The location is central with an easy walk over the footbridge to the shopping mall. As a single female traveller I felt safe and secure at the Pullman and would recommend to other solo travellers. It was easy to get taxi's from the hotel and I used their transfer service to/from the airport which was five star and reasonable priced with no hassle at all.The restaurant is fantastic as is the service! As a gluten free traveller it was so easy to find an array of menu items to choose from, and the sushi was the freshest and tastiest I have ever had. The gym facilities are extensive with plenty of equipment even a smith machine. The pool is large and plenty of sunbeds. The rooms are modern and spacious with comfortable beds.I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't stayed at this hotel but wanted to comment on the lunch buffet which is outstanding. I believe it won the award for the best lunch in Jakarta 2014 and it really is worth a visit. A fantastic range of Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, and western food in different stations, all excellent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman Jakarta for a number of times ever since it was under the old management. Its location is just next to our Main Jakarta Office, but that was not the main reason for me to choose Pullman. I choose Pullman Jakarta as it offers me best experience, quality time and services.The room is nicely decorated, modern design, spacious and clean. The bed is so comfortable. The room services is great. I had once arrived at almost midnight (due to flight delay, typical problem with some airways.. sighh..), the staff was friendly and helpful to prepare me a midnight snack/dinner. By the time I finish my dishes, it was at around 2.00 am. Don't skip your breakfast! There were a lot of choices of foods during breakfast at Pullman Jakarta. I love the Japanese dishes plus the dim sums, and many more.. :)Friendly staff (eh, I said it already). There's a fitness center for hotel's guest. Strategically located in the middle of the city, The Plaza and other shopping complex is just a walking distance away. Eateries are also nearby. I like to eat Indonesian 'nasi padang' at one of the restaurant in the Plaza Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I stayed at Pullman Hotel again for 2 nights (29 Nov - 1 Dec'14) since our last visit to Jakarta. We're in Jakarta for my friend's wedding which was held at Grand Hyatt (across Pullman Hotel).Because of my previous great & memorable experience staying at Pullman Hotel, I still chose Pullman over Grand Hyatt (although my soon-to-be-married friend could get me a 'special rate' at Hyatt).My choice was correct. Pullman didn't disappoint me. The hotel puts in lotsa efforts in ensuring that every touch point (the concierge, the check-in receptionist, the wait staff at the cafe etc) delights its guest. Of course I still need to give another 2 thumbs up to Sana Sini Restaurant where the hotel serves its breakfast. Its sumptuous spread makes me look forward to breakfast every morning. Can't wait to be back here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We came to Jakarta for visit our friends. Rooms are perfect. Not too large and not too small. I love the design interiors. Modern and also still put Indonesian things like wayang decoration in the wall.Breakfast was good, they has different food from different area. Indonesia food, Japanese, Chinese's, westrn. U also can order the food, choose what u want to mix cooked by chef directly in Chinese corner. They serve fresh juices I love it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel's been re-branded, renovated not too long ago and hence it looks great the moment you step into the lobby. Service Staff were ALWAYS on hand(at the front of the hotel, in cafes and room service etc) and we dined various meals at the cafe and lounge - seriously great quality & a massive variety to choose from. The rooms are sizable and provides everything one need either on business or pleasure. Had the chance to connect with the F/B Manager - Jaya ; great personality and always smiling. The hotel boasts a great gym, pool & spa facility as well. the cherry on the top is the LOCATION! - Amazing!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually it's my second visit to Jakarta but it's my first time to stay in Pullman thamrin, it's an excellent hotel that would suite my expectations or any one else, the hotel location is excellent as it's in the heart of Jakarta , the hotel management has already started putting of Christmas tree in the middle of the lobby that gives a nice ambiance in the hotel. The breakfast is excellent it's in the lobby floor and has got many varieties to eat as they have several food stations. Staff as well are very friendly and helpful and there is always a smile on their face. Special thanks to badriah from guest relations to all her assistance and zemmy from concierge with his natural hospitable attitude.for sure I will back and thanks for all your assistance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this class of hotel, to be honest I expected something better in term of the service. I didn't know how the system here, but the other hotels in the same class I got more benefit. I stayed with my friend here and the breakfast was not automatically given for two persons each room as I knew the other hotels gave. It's a shame since the price can't be categorized as cheap since the class is different.The location was good and the staff were nice and helpful. Wellness and spa was available at the second floor to accommodate guest need to stay fit during their visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was keeping my fingers crossed as I had a terrible experience on my last visit. Arrived at 4pm after a horrendous storm in Jakarta but room wasn't ready. The usual excuse "the room has been cleaned and ready but needed to be inspected". Decided to grab some food but was informed the cafe (Sana Sini) was closed. Was redirected to "KEMIXTRI" as they have ala carte menu there. Bill came and was not offered any discount as I'm a Platinum Advantage Plus Member. Was informed by server that they do not offer discount for Advange members. Hur?!!! Knowing that the staffs in this hotel is poorly educated by the management on their products and offerings, I decided not to pursue. So before heading out that evening, I informed the lady whom helped me with the check in and she said Advantage members are entitiled to the 50% discount on food and she will act accordingly and revise the bill.Checked in and room was upgraded. Received all the perks of a platinum member. Thank you. Though the 3 apples in the room was a tad miserable. Room was satisfactory. Breakfast was commendable. A great spread of western, local, chinese and japanese delights available and generally tasty. On the day of the check out, the bill only reflected 10% discount for the food (reason being "Kemixtri" was a bar and not a restuarant). Firstly, food was entitled to 50% for 2 person (even on the Accor Advantage Plus website, there was not exclusion) and secondly the cafe was not opened and I've to settle for "Kemixtri". Anyway, I didn't pursue futher as I didn't want to upset myself and settled the bill.Foremost, as a 5 star hotel, how could your cafe be closed at 4pm? The staff are not competent again and again. They don't seem to be versed of their products and offerings. What a shame!Else from that, it was a nice stay. Much better than the last time.The refurbished rooms has been done up tastefully and breakfast was great!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all I would like to thank the front office for upselling us to the Deluxe room in the new renovated building. My children enjoyed their 2 nights weekend stay(because the room was big..the standard/superior is too small for more than 2 people) and we just needed to walk across the road to enjoy the shopping centers, cinemas, and dining near the hotel.The hotel facilities (swimming pool & fitness center) was well kept and the staff was very attentive to our needs. Housekeeping did a good job in taking care of the room too!We look forward for our next visit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I went there last May as I visited my sister on mothers day in Jakarta.You can see the work they have done to revive the place.We went for their mothers day brunch, great selection of food and well executed, the wine selection could have been better though but I know it is difficult to get good wines here.the location at the Bundaran HI is very convenient and I would certainly come back
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thamrin Pullman is my favorite hotel in Jakarta for Business and Leisure. It is priced accordingly and has a great lounge for meetings and socializing.The staff are always polite and extremely helpful. My friend had dropped her phone on the lounge and we got it back. That to me is a fantastic outcome and in my eyes the staff are honest and diligent in making sure things are safe for the guest.Keep up the good work. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Returned to Jakarta middle of November, stayed at the Pullman as usual and was not disappointed. Room was clean and fresh, bed most comfortable, service wonderful and staff all very friendly. The hotel will certainly remain my go to whenever I visit for some time to come.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a business traveller and my stay at Pullman Jakarta was my first. Boy was I impressed. The hotel has been renovated, and the design of the hotel and the rooms, etc. was just beautiful - modern, sleek and luxurious. And the breakfast buffet is to die for. This is the first hotel I've been to that serves mantou for breakfast. OMG. Location is great. If I were really trying to find fault, the worst I could say is that perhaps their fitness centre could be a bit bigger (but even then, it was adequate).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Went there for a wedding, which was amazing! Room very large and comfy, big bed and. Lovely bath. Staff very helpful, bit slow in the bar. Breakfast buffet had every type of food you could need. Lovely swimming pool area didnt leave the hotel for whole weekend!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Front office staff welcoming me with great smile, fast check in at front desk, friendly bellboy and nice room. Breakfast is super, it was my best breakfast ever in hotel. I will very happy to visit this hotel next time
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Although have to wait quite long for check in, fortunately the room is not make us disappointed. It is nice, comfy n has good view. Nice pool also for the kids. Perfect for business n weekend getaway. Will stay again someday. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is located very centrally in the heart of Jakarta, good for business travellers working nearby. Service is really good, staff are very warm. Do check in by 6pm, otherwise your reservation may get automatically cancelled, which happened to my colleague. They somehow managed to find him a room after an hour though. The lobby is very grand but rooms are not very spacious and feels a little old, stains at the corners of bathroom, though it is generally clean. Great that wifi was free and available in all parts of the hotel. As others have mentioned, breakfast choices are amazing, never seen such a huge selection before - Indonesian, Western, Chinese, Indian, Japanese cuisines all available in an abundance of varieties. Overall, very value for money.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've never seen that many options of breakfast anywhere else... It's like a heaven for foodies.Comfortable bed and pillow options - but it's quite similar in every 5-star hotel. The room is a tad too small, but very cosy. I left one of my cosmetics accidentally and they kept it for me for a 3-month duration. I though that was generous.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location. Not far from the airport. Took about 20mins on an off peak period. We arrived for the weekend to explore Jakarta and arrived at the hotel at 5am. The lobby was decorated with minimalist design. It was in a safe area and close by to the big malls. But crossing the roads were an experience! The rooms are quite spacious but toilet was too small. The breakfast buffet was good md plenty of choices. We even tried the signature hot chocolate down at Le Chocolate cafe. Even managed to try the spa but it was NOT great. The spa receptionist was sloppy and wasn't tidy. Guess I shouldn't compare to the likes of Bali or Thailand. Overall, good place to stay. I would recommend if you like to be close to the big malls for shopping :) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel organised a Golden Bird taxi transfer from the airport, I was pleased to see my name on the board as I approached the desk straight after customs. Every member of the door staff was friendly and had a bottle of water ready for me along with some interested questions regarding where I was coming from and if I'd ever visited Jakarta beforeAs an Accor Platinum, I was upgraded to a large suite with dining table and full kitchen, along with a living area. Additional benefits were numerous and comprehensive and were explained to me both at check in and with a letter placed in my room. The breakfast buffet was great, with varied choices and of a high quality, service as ever was efficient and friendly. I ordered a few items from room service which met the same standardLocation of this hotel was great, every taxi driver knew where it was and Plaza Indonesia is right across the road. I highly recommend this property and it would be my only choice when returning to Jakarta. I had been flying all day before arrival and while that may have caused some bias, I thought the bed in my suite was amongst the most comfortable I've ever slept in
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I started staying at this particular property beginning of 2014. I have been staying here for a couple of months, and gone from Classic to Platinum status. I have been rather satisfied with the hotel, and overall services. However, I noticed that the service standards have been dropping recently.For the last couple of weeks, I noticed two reoccurring problems. The first being that the wifi doesn't provide a stable connection. It either doesn't log you in, or it keeps dropping. I resorted to either using my own mifi or the LAN cable. The second matter about housekeeping is the one that irks me the most.I noticed that housekeeping does not refill or provide new bottles of bathroom amenities. I'm not sure if this is part of any effort to start being green (no notice about it) but it is rather annoying having to call housekeeping almost daily to get refills. At a certain point, you just ask for an entire week's worth of supplies. On one occasion, I noticed that the bathroom hasn't been cleaned thoroughly from use by the last occupant. Mistakes happen, and I was okay to let that one slip.The "last straw" was when I noticed small blood stains that wasn't cleaned from the previous occupant's use, and checking into a "new" room with half used bathroom amenities. That just went beyond gross. If it wasn't for business, I would prefer other boutique hotels around the area, with similar offerings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, the location of the hotel is good but a little walk across the bridge to the Plaza Indonesia. Interior decoration was very attractive, room was nice but a bit small compare to other hotel, maybe its an old Nikko Japanese chain hotel. moreover, i felt the water pressure was not strong enough, even after they fix it, it was not satisfy. what i like most is breakfast, the hotel has so many variety to offer and all are great. I regret that I didn't try the pool or gym. will defintely recommend for either business or family holidays.Pros:-- really good breakfast- good location, center of the city- nice interior- friendly staffCons:-- room a bit small- shower too weak
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed there last weekend for just a short getaway with my wife. I found it a really good hotel actually, staffs are helpful and nice, good pool and gym, delicious food, and easy access.The only problem i got was the drainage system in my bathroom. I filled the bathtub half full and i had checked the edge of the bathtub was dry at that time (so no water spilled out), but after i finished my bath, the floor was covered all over with water, even my room carpet got wet! This was really annoying which i had to deal with the "wet" room and it started to be smelled bad at that time (it was late at night).I do really like accor brand hotels, so i hope this problem would be fixed immediately so that there will be no such problem like this again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is one of my favourite hotel in Jakarta.. Service is very good, so many people ready to help and all of them are so kind and proffesional. Very clean and fragrant at lobby, room, sanasini restaurant, swimmingpool and wellness center. Very complete breakfast, so many and good taste. The best of this hotel for me is great location, we can see bundaran HI from our room, plaza indonesia & grand indonesia shopping mall is about 5-15 minutes walk 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been going to Jakarta on business for about twenty years. The city gets more crowded and difficult to navigate every year. For that reason, I chose a hotel based primarily on location on my last trip. The Pullman is located write in the middle of the city, close to Plaza Indonesia, Menteng, and several restaurants and hotels. Not having to constantly find taxis reduced my stress level.I got a great internet price on the accor hotels website. As others have noted, the hotel includes two wings, one with smaller/older rooms, and the other with newer/larger rooms. I opted for a room in the older wing because the price was right and I don't usually spend a lot of time in my room anyway. The room was small, but nicely decorated and clean. The wireless service was excellent. The best part of the hotel, though, was the fantastic buffet breakfast, which includes Indonesian, Japanese, and Western stations, with an omelette bar, an endless supply of breads, and delicious homemade yoghurt. Another highlight was the spa/gym. The Pullman is not as opulent as some of the other international hotels in Jakarta, but it offers outstanding service, good food, all at a reasonable price. I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This our first time to stay in Pullman Hotel brand. They have the best location in the heart of Jakarta where you can enjoy the scheduled car free day in the main street during the weekend. It is also just opposite the shopping malls.The lobby is big with grand staircase.The room we stayed is facing the Thamrin view, so it is a nice view. Though the space is quite small (25 sqm), however it is still comfortable.Service of the staff is ok for us. The only highlight is the breakfast at Sanasini Restaurant. It is a massive food!!! Nice variety of asian and western cuisine..it is worth every penny! We would come back to try their brunch someday!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

there are two wings in the hotel, i call it, old & small or new & big...I was first put in the old & small room but due to some issues, i was generously upgraded to the new & big wing where all the rooms are a lot bigger.Normal taxi from the airport is about Rp150,000 with toll. With the preferred limousines, it's about Rp300,000, just so you know.The lobby restaurant has nice breakfast, as expected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my first trip to Jakarta and staying at the Pullman Hotel was an amazing experience. It was so centrally located, that walking to the malls was very convenient as trying to take taxis around Jakarta can be very frustrating as the city center is known for traffic congestion. The breakfast buffet was truly amazing as the choice of cuisine and dishes was extensive. The room was very well renovated, and having a separate living area was great. The gym was excellent! The staff were very extremely helpful. I loved this hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Jakarta is centrally located and just across Plaza Indonesia which is a huge shopping mall. The hotel is an ideal business hotel and it is quite luxurious. My room was big and comfortable with top notch amenities and toiletries, and a comfortable bed. The food was good, be it the coffee house or room service. A good, clean hotel with very capable and friendly staff. I enjoyed my stay and will be returning again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed regularly at the Pullman, and the rooms are really rather cramped. Well-equipped, though. Breakfast and other food is outstanding.Problem is that the rates are rising very fast, and I'm not sure in can still calll it a 'good deal'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman, in order to get closer to Jakarta Marathon venue. It's location is so perfect to do so. Great experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out. Our 7 years old daughter love the pool, and she made some new friends there. While my wife really enjoyed the room. The Jakarta Marathon venue was in the National Monument, 20 minutes walk. The room wasn't grand, but it sufficed our needs. Free internet access, pillow choices, and others.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location and breakfast spread, the breakfast has 4 sections, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian and western. But it took me awhile to get a quiet room even when I have requested clearly in my booking.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a good stay at this hotel, facing Thamrin road & Plaza Indonesia shopping mall which is the main road of Jakarta. The deluxe room is quite huge, complete with kitchen area and coffee machine. There's no complimentary apples or chocolate as described by another guest, but it's ok.. the bed is comfy and the room looks modern and clean. I checked-in Sat Oct 18 around 1pm but only get the room i requested 2 hours later as i rejected the first one offered with the parking lot view. I thought it would be empty during weekend as it's more of a business hotel.. anyway, it's not the hotel's fault. I enjoyed the swimming pool and gym facilities.. and of course, the breakfast which was superb.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location very good , its center of jakarta , food very good, room design ( the new wing) very nice, smell good, small swimming pool, small spa, all hotel employee good and nice, only spa reception not nice and not welcome very bad score..... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A beautiful hotel with great rooms, helpful staff and a wonderful selection of restaurants to eat at. My partner and I only stayed at the Pullman for 2 nights prior to our holiday in Bali and although there wasn't too much to do around the hotel we spent most of our time enjoying the rooftop pool, the many surrounding restaurants and rooftop bars, and the incredible (and pretty cheap compared to London prices) cocktail bar at the hotel. Would definitely recommend a stay here for a short city break.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay second time in this hotel and this time get new grand deluxe room. This new room much better than old room that pullman acquired from old owner. Modern room with new design bathroom and new bathtub. Amenities in bathroom also good. Overaal is good hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a Great hotel i can say... if the room is bigger than it is. I'm not usually staying at Pullman, but sometimes yes i'm staying here as my business trip need me to stay around this area. Hotel is very good, clean, and nice (i think just renovated ya), room is tiny but clean, so not complaining much. Breakfast... i didn't try it as i miss it.Location is fantastic, just cross the road you can find shopping mall Plaza Indonesia. Other thing that i miss also is that, if i took taksi (silver bird) from the hotel, they say that i can't charge to my room.... WHAT?... im staying at other hotel nearby and they can charge to my room, i don't like to bring alot of money to pay taksi fare in Jakarta... i hope that they can improve.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently i stayed here on oct 18 to oct 19, i booked the superior room if remember correctly but then your friendly receptionist, Martinus, offered me to upgrade the room to deluxe, i was so pleased with it since i didnt have to use my upgrade room voucher, in the room i found complementary apples n chocolate n a note from Mr. Raul Aquino the Hotel Manager welcoming me to Pullman Hotel, omg i thought what is this?? I felt so special that day. Then i wud also like to mention that your bell boy, Yoga, also helped me with my things. Then Suci from cs also came to my room to make sure my room meets my expectation, and of course it exceeded my expectation. At night i came down to meet my friend n of course we had buffet dinner at Sana Sini, omg i was in heaven, the food was very delicious n my compliments to the chef. On the check out counter i was helped by Intan, another friendly receptionist. Thank you once again for the privillege. Im an Accor Advantage Plus gold member n i still have the complementary night voucher n will definitely return to your excellent hotel. Ouw btw, pls check the shower in room 1107, i cundt use it, i used the head shower instead. *another happy customer*
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Convenient location near to central.Service level is good.Former brand JAL hotel Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is in a great location amongst Jakarta's major malls (actually can be walked in just a few minutes thanks to an overpass, unlike many short trips in Jakarta, where a taxi is often necessary for short trips). We stayed in one of the older building rooms, which was still nicely fitted and of a decent size. The pool area was fine, though unfortunately there was bar to buy even non-alcoholic drinks, and the deck was very slippery. We stayed while there was some renovation occurring on one of the restaurants, but we found that main restaurant, where breakfast was served, was well designed and with Pullman's usual good service and excellent food selection, and KeMixTry bar was a real highlight. It had a fantastic selection of delicious, if Western-priced, cocktails and a good choice of equally high quality tapas. Absolutely worth dropping in, regardless of whether you stay at the hotel or not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are going to check into Pullman Thamrin located in Jakarta Pusat, do take a Silverbird from the airport and you will be in good hands.Pullman Thamrin is strategically located in the heart of Central Jakarta within walking distance of Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia. Consequently food choices are never an issue.The staffs are very friendly and check in is efficient. There are 2 wings in the hotel. One wing has recently been refurbished and it clearly reflected in the prices.However most of the hotel podium are is still under refurbishment but since it's location is near shopping centers, it does not matter.Next tour is Wisma Nusantara. There is a good money changer located on the first floor who gives good rates for Ruppiah.For those who wants to tryout Masakan Minangkabau, you can tryout Natrabu, Minang Restaurant at Jalan Sabang which is parallel to Jalan Thamrin. This restaurant serves dignitaries like the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahatir Mohamad & many more.However, sad to say the restaurant located on the ground floor, Sana Sini charges for water even though if you were to order an entree, main course and drinks. Consequently avoid dining internally but take a nice walk to the malls where choices are many and no surprises that could spoil your evening.A great hotel for business as it's strategically located and with a fleet of Silverbird taxis on standby, you can easily get to your appointments in Jakarta.I would have rated it higher if not for the management decision to charge for water.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were impressed at the beginning with the location and the facilities offered by this hotel. The only problem we had was that they set up a wrong automatic alarm clock which woke us up at 5 am in the morning and made us very tired the whole day. If we were staying in Ritz Carlton Singapore, we would have been given a free entry to the buffet dinner for a similar kind of human error made. But well, what can we expect, this hotel only offers a "minimal" customer service by bringing us a basket of fruit as a sign of apologies, like as if that will take away the exhaustiveness we had to go through the whole day due to lack of sleep. If I weren't pregnant, I may have been more forgiving, well unfortunately this time around I really need my beauty sleep.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman in central Jakarta (there is another one at Central Park, further out), was a top class hotel in every respect (apart from the disgusting smoke filled bar).Firstly the rooms were spacious, modern, clean and well maintained. The rooms were very quiet, and I did not hear any noise from my neighbours nor the corridor. There is a new metro system being installed at the front of the hotel, and the works continued until late evening, but were not particularly noisy. The only gripe I had about the room was that there were no light switches at all on the right side of the bed (a little frustrating last thing at night).The hotel breakfast was sumptuous in its range and quality. There were 4 separate workstations, each offering a different style of cuisine for breakfast (European, Indonesian, Chinese or Japanese). Each work station offered either pre-prepared buffet food or you could order special dishes at will. I was spoilt for choice every morning.I only went to the hotel restaurant one night. The food was good, but over-priced and the service was average. Generally I headed to the shopping centre across the road to eat.The hotel has a proper swimming pool (i.e. you can swim real lengths, and there is a deep end for diving). There is also a smaller splash pool for children.The gym is well equipped and maintained. The changing rooms have steam room, sauna cabin, ice bath and jacquzzi.The hotel bar is a real disappointment from a non-smoker perspective. The bar looks trendy, but is almost exclusively for smokers, and it stank (and I do mean stank) of cigarettes. There was a small glassed alcove for the non-smokers, but it only had four tables and was constantly full (while the smoking section was half-deserted. I only ventured in once, and vowed never to return.The customer service is generally very good and welcoming. Occasionally though the staff would pretend to understand English, when they obviously had no idea what I was talking about. The location is great, right in the heart of the city. There are two massive shopping centres immediately next to the hotel. While the ground floor is a sea of luxury brands, there is plenty of more reasonable priced fare on other floors, and lots of choice for places to eat in the shopping centre.The free wifi was of a high standard and worked throughout the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely unbelievably great value for money and very high overall standards and attentive service. quiet and comfortable room. we enjoyed the most wonderful and highly diversified breakfast buffet, which we ever had: positive "warning" to potential future guests: you need at least 5 days to even try from all the variously themed stations at the breakfast buffet. When in Jakarta, don't waste your time on looking for another hotel, this is THE place to stay at… for the equivalent price of a Swiss Youth Hostel!!  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed 5 nights for business in the hotel and overall it was a good experience, value for money I would call it.Yes, the rooms are smaller as in most Asian hotels, but you also have the freedom to opt for the new refurbished rooms in the west wing ( at a higher cost).Reception staff is professional with prompt check in and fast delivery of the luggage.The bar is a cozy place to enjoy a drink and the restaurant has a good choice of different styles of food.What impressed me most was the follow up on a minor complaint I had issued on the survey they asked me to fill in.The guest experience manager Mrs Dina was very quick in responding and asking for a meeting to hear my remarks. This is the first time ever a hotel goes through such an effort to listen to a customer. Great to see that some hotels do not see a customer as a number, but rather as a real guest. So thank you Dina for your kind assistance.I would definitely go back but book a larger room for the comfort and space.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrived hotel at 7pm and stayed for one night, check in was smooth. Good size to the room, comfortable bed, good amenities and clean. Location is near Grand Indonesia, so do consider the jam during peak hours. During my stay, there was some construction right in front of the hotel and I don't think it's going to be done by the end of the year. However, I had a good sleep at night as the bed was very comfortable. Front desk could have been better with their service considering it's a 5-star hotel, nevertheless, a recommended hotel in the area. Overall, I had a pleasant stay. I stayed at Pullman Central Park the next 3 nights. Both are very good hotels, but if you are considering these two hotels, decide based on their location considering the traffic in Jakarta. Experience and service wise, I prefer my stay at Pullman Central Park.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We arrived in the afternoon, the staffs were really friendly. The lobby was big and spacious but not too many chairs around. They handled everything fast which is also a plus. The buffet were really wow, so many choices to eat. We ate until full there :)Over all the food were great, the location also perfect, and the hotel was really great! Everything was great!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We booked a grand deluxe room, and it was spacious, with ample space for our luggage, a work desk, a couch, and a oh-so-comfy king sized bed that I didn't want to leave. The sheets on the bed bear special mention - they have a really high thread count and are an absolute joy against your skin. The toilet has a bathtub and separate shower and toilet, which I really appreciate. Amenities are good quality and of the usual variety you get in a 5 star hotel. The hotel furnishings are well appointed and modern. Breakfast was a mind-boggling selection from all parts of the world, all of which tasted good except the egg station. I was not impressed by the scrambled eggs, but that's a small complaint. Service was brilliant, the bellhops were attentive and the front desk friendly and helpful. The spa closes over the Hari Raya Haji period however, something to take note of. Location-wise, not as ideal as the Hyatt; you have to sweat the 5 minute walk on the streets and over the overpass to Plaza Indonesia versus an airconditioned connection that the Hyatt has (mark my words, 15 seconds outside and you will be feeling a little moist around the pits), but this hotel IS about half the price of the Mandarin/Hyatt. Given the choice, I pick sweating over spending. The pool is reasonably large for a city hotel. All in all, a very pleasant stay and I would not hesitate to pick Pullman again on my next trip to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for 4 nights when doing business in CBD Jakarta. The hotel is just renovated, huge room, quite, good breakfast, nice gym facilities and it's within walking distance to Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia. Two major shopping mall with selections of restaurants.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have seen this hotel evolve over the past few years and it is at a really great place at the moment. Good food modern sleek design, great health facilities and pool. Not fussy like some of its competitors but straightforward and good value. Stay in Tower annex for upgraded rooms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is the former nikko hotel and it has been spruced up as a new Pullman, the facilities are okay and the pool and spa are nice. The rooms are very small and the bathroom had mould all around the sealant of the shower and on the curtain of the shower. Breakfast is also average with large choice but little done exceptional. What annoyed me most was the they charged us extra 40% on the published rate for a 2 hr later check out and never notified us until check out, baring in mind we didn't check in until 5am I thought this took the piss! For the price of this hotel there are many better options, especially when you factor the extras and taxes etc on the room price. I would go for the kempinsky, shangrila, melia, ritz, Marriott, Hyatt (over the street) or 4 seasons for around the same price, much better standard on room food and service around. This Pullman is more like a 3/4star business hotel that I wouldn't pay more than 80usd for, I won't be returning to this outlet and will probably not revisit the brand on my own accord of this is how their sops work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin has one of the best rooms and amenities. Not to mention their comfy beds that won't let you wake out of your deep sleep. I used Accor Advantage Plus to get a free room upgrade, luckily i was given some sort of junior suite and it was a spacious room in the heart of Jakarta. Its located next to two of thr most prestigious shopping malls and theyre just 5 minute walk away from your room. Breakfast was another brilliant service. Tons of choices of food that will spoil your tastebuds. Truly an excellent experience and an unforgettable weekend. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin is one of exceptional 5* hotel in the heart of capital Jakarta. Ease to go around for business meetings and pleasantly comfy rooms and facilities to relax afterwards. Worth the price big time. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic hotel, had maybe a little too small room...and the lunchbuffet...was so fantastic...dont miss it..if iam going back to Jakarta i will choose this hotel. Nice pool and nice area around with a big mall next to hotel.A nice stay in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a great 3 week stay at the Pullman Thamrin, from my airport pickup to my checkout. Customer service was exceptional. Everyone there was very friendly, helpful and trustworthy, Romi, my room attendant, Aulia, Putri, Ricki, Ehffy and Yulia to name a few. The rooms are very spacious, clean with a great view and a pillow menu.The breakfast buffet, Lunch buffet and dinner at the Sana Sini restaurant was excellent. Service and selection at the Kemixtri bar was very good. This hotel is at a great location, a very famous landmark roundabout just outside the hotel and 2 great malls across the street with everything you might want or need. From clubs, movies to clothes, cafe's and restaurants, you name it and it's right across the street. Very convenient!If you need to get your currency exchanged, there's a money changer on the first floor in the building next door (Wisma Nusanatara) or in the mall. I preferred to go to the mall (BBC money exchanger) as It stayed open longer and gave a better exchange rate!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent Business Hotel, Good Location next to good mall. Rooms are spacious and Modern.Services are good and quick from friendly staff. Breakfast Buffet is good selection ( only if you are ready to explore different food specially for Indians :-)).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice hotel to stay. It was my third time visited. the room was modern, fast wi fi connection, and clean. All staffs are friendly and professional. I got a birthday cake surprised when i was entered my room. The breakfast buffet so great. Pleasant place to stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for work for one night and chose this hotel for location and competitive price. The rooms were fine, clean, and had good pillow options. But I wasn't that impressed with the service. After checking in, no one bothered guiding us to the elevators (though my colleague and I didn't need an escort really, a simple "The elevators are that way," would have sufficed) so we were left wandering the vast lobby in the complete opposite direction in front of a non-responsive elevator before someone finally turned up to point us in the right way. Then when I returned after my day, I found that the wifi was no longer working so I called Guest Services, and it took about 25 minutes for an IT guy to show up. But once he did turn up, he was very competent and sorted out my problem right away (and no, it wasn't me being silly this time, which admittedly is the case 9 out of 10 times when it comes to IT issues). I also specifically checked off a box not to receive the surveys during check in but I just received one today, which is a mild annoyance. However, the breakfast. My goodness, the breakfast was just splendid! Huge spread with everything from traditional Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, Western, fresh fruits, fresh squeezed juices, pastries, eggs, noodles, everything I could have wanted. My only regret was that I didn't have enough time to sample every single dish. Also the location is fantastic, so next time I'm in Jakarta, I will come back here, at least for the breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying at grand deluxe king size bed. I have stayed at this hotel for 2 times and I had great time for both of my stays. They have friendly staff with modern design of room. The room also very spacious. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Situated in the city center, walking distance to shopping mall, eateries and street food. The rooms are okay and comfortable. Security is number one. The conference venue is just across the street, very convenient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location at city centre. Nice restaurant with great cuisines. Great variety if food served in restaurant. Cosy room though a little small. Friendly staffs. Speedy service when request for things. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 1 night at Pullman Jakarta. Location is in the heart of city of Jakarta. In front of Bundaran HI/ Patung Selamat Datang (welcome statue).Very Close to the mall , across of the hotel you will find Plaza Indonesia shopping mall and next to it is Grand Indonesia shopping mall.It just about close to anywhere. The room is new but small. There are complete amenities and great cable TV.If you bring children, there is a playground at the lobby . The most I love is the breakfast time.They served a breakfast at Sana Sini Restaurant. There are so many choices.Indonesian food, Japanese food, Chinese food, Indian food , american breakfast , even traditional herbal drinks for your health.All the juices made from real fresh fruit. They served broad choices of coffee and dessert.The restaurant is spacious , no need to queing . The verdict is it has small room but excellent breakfast , all foods are tasty .Love to be back soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Undeniably the best location in Jakarta. 5 min walk away to largest mall in Jakarta Grand and plaza Indonesia. For those who prefer to unwind on the highest and coolest bar and restaurant The Skye top 56th floor Menara BCA offers best night or sunset view of jakarta. Friendly reception, great food breakfast and dinner at Sana Sini made my stay great. Front guest officer Bunga was attentive polite was another plus factor. Prompt in solving complaints and queries. Dina Tambubolon the manager was apologetic and no doubt a fantastic customer "recovery" service. Awesome!Room for 2 single beds was rather compact but comfortable and clean. It would be better if shower is more powerful. Beginning to appreciate hotels from Accor group. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I often stay at this hotel cause of its convenient place and nice newly-renovated lobby. I should say that the lobby smells nice and the new breakfast n resto buffet are nice. But the service is just so so, cause at the first time i check in at the lobby they told me that no upgrade available, and they insist me to pay more while they have an even better room to offer. Then I say that im a regular customer to Pullman Thamrin, they still didnt believe me until I call the manager and I just say that im disappointing with the service of their kinda flat and cold face, because i didn't expect of this kinda of service in a luxury hotel like pullman. At the end, they just giving me the upgrade whilethey said like next time we cant offer you this advantages, again with flat and defensive spoke, feels like so dis pleasant. I expect better for a hotel like pullman, again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to stay here due to the central location and proximity to my meetings. When I arrived, I was feeling extremely car sick and uncomfortable due to being stuck in traffic for 3 hours. Hence, I was extremely glad to be able to check in via the Le Club queue immediately upon arrival instead of waiting for the other queues to clear. I think this hotel has the highest level of recognition for Le Club Accor members I have encountered so far, second only to Sofitel Phnom Penh. Not only was I treated like a VIP, but they are also the only other hotel that remembered to provide me with a welcome drink. Rooms were very comfortable, and well-equipped. Beds were very comfortable, but I forgot about the pillow menu, which I would have taken advantage of if I remembered. Nonetheless, the standard pillows themselves were huge marshmallows that gave me the best sleep throughout my whole trip. What made the stay particularly pleasant for me was that my room was equipped with an espresso machine, and loose leaf tea and a plunger. When I saw it, I could have sworn I heard celestial choirs singing. ;)Room service food was relatively well-priced and tasty. Only complaint was that there was no indication of portion size in the menu, which would have been helpful as I ended up ordering too much. Breakfast was excellent! Among the mind-boggling variety, my particular preference was the variety of teas and the waffle/pancake section with clotted cream and honey. On a whole, there were two things I had to comment about the hotel that the management might want to consider improving on. One, directions to the gym and pool were not well indicated, I tried several times and awkwardly ended up at the spa instead. Two, associated shabu-shabu and teppanyaki restaurants were not worth the price and weirdly located in the adjacent building. Kudos to the staff, they made my stay most pleasant. They are a credit to the Accor brand.

This is a copy of a revie i wrote on hotelsdotcom. I've stayed at the nearby grand hyatt, keraton luxury collection (starwood), and the pullman is by far the best value. To be clear, i booked a grand deluxe room in the new tower so i cannot speak for the older rooms. My room was very modern, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent with a huge tub and shower. In my opinion, the room was larger and nicer than the grand hyatt, and much cleaner and in better taste and design than keraton. The pool is excellent and pretty big for laps (unlike the keraton). The spa was great - steam room, jacuzzi and sauna were modern and clean. Hotel massage was very reasonably priced and excellent. The lobby has a nice technology/business center area with free use of windows8 PCs. The restaurant and breakfast buffet is on par with other hotels. The food quality is ok, variety is excellent but i wouldn't choose to eat there if other options were convenient. The only flaw i would note is this hotel requires walking outside and over a shady bridge to access plasa indonesia (whereas keraton and hyatt are connected to the mall). But thats a small price to pay for an excellent hotel that is half the price of the hyatt and keraton. Just make sure to book a grand deluxe room in the new tower!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel, very close to the central Thamrin square, Good service, clean as any 5*hotel, good food. Nice but impersonal pool, confortable bed but not confortable pillows (i tried 2). The rooms street side are very noisy as the windows are not really "sound proof".
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my second time staying at this hotel. The 1st was better. This time, the air con did not work well in my room! Called the front desk but it's still the same. WiFi is another issue! Well, a nice hotel but need to improve their services - waited 15mins before I could checked in but my room was not readily available. Waited another 30mins for the room! The front desk is really slow though polite. Well, the room is still new, clean and tidy. The location is excellent. The hotel security made me at ease. And, the Concierge was very helpful!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Specially requested for this hotel for my work trip due to the excellent location and nearby shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia). But, I am a bit let down by the slow service at the Front Desk though they are very polite. The room is clean and sizeable, but the air con is very weak even at 19C. Told the Front Desk the next morning but still no improvement. In fact, the lobby was colder than the room. Interestingly, the hotel has a pillow menu! I would have an excellent sleep if they fixed the air con issue. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the excellent service at the lobby café with great coffee and bakery - especially the raisin scone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Accor group has really been making an effort in recent times, especially at the upper end brands like Pullman. We were there as part of Kilikanoon Wines first Indonesian market visit, so needed everything to work well, which it did. Large, new, quiet modern room (new wing at the back)- great bed, fine linen, huge fluffy towels, separate toilet. Large TV with good connections for watching your own content. Just a digital clock which turns off when you leave the room needs fixing!Free very fast internet- 4ms ping and 20 mb download is great. As those who read my reviews know, I really think basic internet should always be free (like drinkable water), and I don't mind paying for faster speeds or larger downloads. Don't normally do breakfast, but it was included in our great rate (good rates available online), so I mention here. Wow! 4 different kitchens and cuisines offered- Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and western. Excellent gym and good pool. Finally really friendly and helpful staff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second time I stayed at this hotel, Good hospitality and satisfactory service. Hotel is centrally located at Thamrin. For overseas travellers, make sure that you leave the hotel at least 3-4 hours before your flight departure time as the MRT work could worsen your journey time to airport
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first impression upon entering the deluxe room was that it was very spacious; a lot larger than the deluxe room at Pullman Central Park. I was also impressed by the large bathroom with a nice bath tub. Lastly, the room was stocked with very good amenities, such as loose tea press and coffee maker with cartridges.All the staff are friendly, polite and accommodating, especially the housekeeping staff.I only have 2 minor complaints:1. The hotel staff weren't properly trained on Le Club AccorHotels Platinum privileges. Upon arriving, I headed straight to the empty Priority Desk, only to be directed to go to a normal check in counter. One of my friends in our group was also a Platinum tier member (we showed the staff my friend's membership card) but we were told that only 1 person (me) would be entitled to Platinum privileges.2. The water temperature would often fluctuate for no reason. Since I don't have the habit of taking long showers, this did not really affect me. But I can see how other might have a problem with this.Other than these minor issues, everything else was fantastic. The breakfast buffet spread at the Sana Sini restaurant was really extensive. I also love the interior of the Kemixtri bar and the fact that Platinum members get to enjoy free cocktails and tapas from 6pm to 10pm. That's very generous of them.Lastly, I would like to thank Ms Bunga, Ms Arini and Ms Suci for making my stay an amazing one. I look forward to coming back to Pullman Jakarta again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were very pleased with everything about the hotel. We paid $106 (including taxes, etc.) per night through Agoda. Pool, exercise room, service, security, WIFI, all were first rate. Walkway across to the mall. Bedroom/bathroom window (with shade), so you can watch TV from the tub. Only thing negative, was that the TransJakarta bus stop was not in use there due to construction, so had to walk up to next stop.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed with a friend for two days and the hotel has really impeccable services, helpful staff, spotless rooms and good facilities such as swimming pool, spa, etc. It is in front of some high level shopping malls so you can find anything you may need (and haven't packed). The breakfast was also very ggod. I would suggest to stay there also for the good relationship between price and quality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel hits the perfect balance between luxury and budget. I visited Jakarta on a whim and stayed for four days over the Independence Day celebrations. This was my first trip to Jakarta, but I have been to every country in Asia and stayed in many hotels. The Pullman brand has impressed me in Bangkok, and again in Jakarta. This is the perfect hotel for the first-timer to ease into Jakarta as it has great value, great location, and great amenities.Location: Thamrin is a safe, westernized, and cosmopolitan area. Getting there: I arrived (midnight) and left (5am) at non-peak hours. I used a Silverbird taxi on the meter and it cost 230,000 rupiah each way and took 40 minutes. Eating: I highly recommend the breakfast buffet. There are selections in Western, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, and Singaporean cuisine, as well as a massive pastry and fruit section. It is a great way to experience many local foods without worrying about food poisoning. Right across the street via skybridge, is Plaza Indonesia which also has dozens of restaurants for every budget. If you want to try local foods at the hawker stalls, simply walk or cab north about a half mile and it will be on the right on the block just before the National Monument where the Department of Energy is located. You can't miss it. Just be careful crossing the streets!Rooms: superb for what they charge ($105 a night). I was upgraded to the newer Pullman Tower. The rooms are newly renovated and larger than the main tower. The downside is that there are some bugs to be worked out. I had to change rooms twice upon arrival. The first room had a shower drain that didn't work and no hot water. The second room has faulty A/C. These were on the 9th floor (955 and 957). They cheerfully and immediately moved to 657 (mall side) and had no further issues. I preferred the view of the street, but some may want to be on the pool side which faces east and is quieter and has less traffic noise. The quality of the bed, linens, and amenities is close to five-star. There were no odd stains, smells, or defects in any of the towels or linens. There are four free bottles of water per day in the room. The bathrooms are huge and well-stocked with towels and every toiletry you will need. The glass window is a bit odd, but it opens the space up visually. There is a desk with plenty of power sockets and a VGA connector for the television. The rooms in the Pullman Tower may be newer, but you have to walk about 50 meters from their elevator bank to access the restaurant and main tower elevators that lead to the pool. They are creating direct access from the Pullman Tower to the pool, but the work isn't done yet. I prefer a newer larger room with a bit of a walk, any day.Staff: EXCELLENT. I should mention that I am Asian and experienced no discrimination or poor service. Reza and Sugeng in the Sana Sini restaurant buffet were kind and attentive. Teguh took care of my room. I can't say enough about how courteous, helpful, and friendly the staff were.Pool and gym: There is a shallow pool (5 feet max depth) and a kiddie pool. There were enough chairs and gazebo spaces around during my stay. I recommend using the gazebo and chairs on the far side of the pool as they have the best shade (you will want shade after about 15 minutes in the direct equatorial sun--trust me). The pool bar was not stocked or manned, but I suspect this will be remedied after the renovations are done. There was no pool attendant, but the spa staff came around every so often and removed used towels. They only had a few pool towels left out for guests, but they never ran out. The gym was well-equipped with free weights and cardio machines. The changing area included showers and a jacuzzi.Spa: I got a massage in the spa. This is the one area where one can see how things used to be done from the Nikko. It's definitely geared towards the needs of a Japanese businessman. I suspect that they will adapt to the more uptight western spa styles and procedures with time. Overall: this is a four-star property that gets five-stars for value, location, staff, and facilities. It hits all the right marks for travelers on a reasonable budget who want quality but don't need excessive pampering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying in Pullman for four nights. The location of the hotel is excellent. The room was clean, internet was fast enough. One setback was the waterpressure in the shower, which was very poor. I need to say, that I have never seen so versatile breakfast as Pullman has. The spa was good, they had real Scandinavian sauna, which I was very happy about. They should fix the stairs in the pool though, I almost hurt myself, because the fittings were loose.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The service of the hotel was bad on the way they treated the Asian guest, i need to look for the table myself after they took my room number for breakfast, tea and coffee were not serve and you need to get it yourself. Really with the price that high fir this kind if bad service, no thank you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The property's location is absolutely fantastic ! It is located in the heart of Jakarta city and just opposite of Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia shopping malls. The service was excellent ! Recommended for leisure and business trips. The breakfast was amazing and full of choices, the sana sini restaurant won as the best buffet variety restaurant in 2014, certainly you'll be offered with cuisines from various countries included local and traditional foods. Ms. Azaria as the assistant manager of sana sini restaurant welcomed and assisted me well for my reakfast. Ms. Flo as the guest relation staff helped and assisted me to do check out process and it was outstandingly fast, it took me less than 3 minutes, it is really what necessary and important as a business hotel.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well located in the business district and nearby shopping malls, this hotel is spot on for the business traveller. I took advantage of their attractive pricing to go for the executive deluxe room which is actually two rooms put together so an office area and a bedroom plus greatly enlarged bathing facilities. It worked for me, very comfortable, clean and well maintained. Breakfast in the ground floor Sani Suni restaurant was excellent with a huge range of dishes from numerous serving stations. Room service and laundry both efficient and reasonably priced. A winner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in Pullman Thamrin for 4D3N business trip and it was a pleasant stay. Started from the excellent airport transfer service to every little details, all the staff really catered to all my needs, even the silliest ones.A special thanks for Reza (if I remember correctly) from Resto Sana Sini, for his kind attentive service during our lunches in the restaurant. He's definitely a good asset to have in your hotel! 4 thumbs up Mr Reza!As for the room, it was an amazing one! Overlooking the busy Jalan MH Thamrin, it was one of the best I've ever been in my life. With 2 giant malls across the street, it's definitely worth staying at. Didn't get the chance to try the pool, but definitely going to try on my next stay.Hotel amenities are amazing too! Everything was perfect! You're definitely on top my list Pullman Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Its a wonderful stay. I was asking front desk staff if i can upgrade my room with accor advantage voucher, while i have bad experience previously in accor hotel for same request, in Pullman Jakarta, thank you front staff (Sorry i forgot the name). My room very spacious and modern, breakfast delicious and wide variety, overall its very pleasant experience.Thank youAgus
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel, with a great location. Rooms are small but well decorated and comfortable. Helpful staff and the main point a beautiful buffet !The only negative point I see is the pool area, especially during the week end, not enough loungers and poor decoration. We tried to find a place to seat and towels are left on the seats.We ordered twice some food and it took about 1 hour to get the order served, there is no waiter near the pool… and you need to have the chance to catch a pool staff…Clearly its a business hotel and surely not for families chilling at the pool, but its a big negative point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel sits right on the most happening street in Jakarta and famous roundabout “bundaran HI “ and which is easily accessed by walking out to the most prestigious and elegant shopping mall Plaza and Grand Indonesia .The hotel metamorphosed from President Hotel to Nikko and now a Pullman Thamrin with new beautiful hip hotel with touch of modern-art deco lobby and new Food and beverage venues plus new rooms and lot of more...I stayed in the new renovated room with the still “modern breath and dramatic touches of color, a large and view directly to the Sudirman street and high rise tower views. . It feels trendier and truly luxurious. Despites my opinion of the room size, there is one common perception and the most popular guest’s that want to have in every stay is… comfortable and surrounded by friendly staffs all around the corners. I can see the smile of the security in front of the lift , the warm greeting of the reception and helpful waiter and waitress. check in and out is very efficient and fast. I can say that Pullman put a lot of efforts in the food and beverage area, which I got my super breakfast with various of foods and beverages, from Chinese noodle to Japanese sushi bar and full range of western breakfast. Bottom-line whatever you are just a business traveller, honeymooners, or a gourmet, all of the above breakfast experience will guarantee to set you spectacularly attractive hyper breakfast experience. Although today’s president hotel is no way resembles the original, it turns to the new trendy Pullman Thamrin with great experiences both in room and F& B, easy to access and prime location in the heart of Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is located at the iconic location in jakarta,with 3 shopping malls just in walking distance.As one of five star hotels in the area,this hotel has a good value for money,the service is good,hotel staffs are friendly and helpfull,hotel facilities are good.the buffet gets the highest point,you can find most of iconic dishes from 5 continents.though we stay in the junior suite,the bathroom area is not spacious.but they do provide sufficient kitchen/dining utensils in the pantry.overall we enjoy staying here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

we are very satisfy with the services during our stays in pullman thamrin hotel in jakarta, indonesia. The room is also big and clean. The complimentary in the room is very good. Our children likes the bathtub and the pool   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We feel glad to stay over at Pullman Thamrin. Executive Suite room is very spacy and well facilitated (it is supposed to come with free minibar, but because we upgrade from lower room class, it was stripped away from us). All in all, can't wait for our next trip here..... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

plaza indonesia and grand indonesia shopping centre is very close, trans jakarta bus terminal is very close can take you to every where you need. Breakfast was delicious, must select for grand deluxe room because standart room is to small   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice environment & atmosphere.Almost all of the food are great & many choices to choose.Free WiFi, measured 9 Mbps but very unstable.Usually only get 1-2 Mbps + 30min down timeThe room is nice but a bit small.If you bring 1 kid (5yo. or younger) it will fit.Overall it's a great hotel that close to major Mall in Jakarta (Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall the Pullams is ok, even though the rooms are small by comparison to other , less expensive hotels. The hotel is well organised and staff most helpful.The wifi is excellent and reliable which was important for me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed in this hotel for four nights, got upgraded to deluxe room as my husband is a platinum member of Accor. It was a nice room, a great deal for its price. Breakfast is so far the best I've had in Jakarta. Tried other restaurants like in most five star hotels in Jakarta and I still think Sana Sini is the best.Swimming pool and gym are quite spacious for us. Locations is the best. Service from the hotel staff was excellent. We complained about the bad smell from the toilet and they fixed it right away. I think I underestimated Pullman Jakarta before. It truly is a splendid stay for us.Would definitely come back and recommend.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A nice hotel in prime location with a very excellent restaurant named sana sini. We have a good times here. Easy and fast check in check out. Fast room service. Clean room and nice view to thamrin street.   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is excellent, front office n the manager also polite...but the restaurant staff named "sasa " should be trained customer relation, even she gave wrong information, didn't say any sorry and showing her unpleasant face... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is typical Pullman quality. Service is top notch, Breakfast is like most hotels in Asia, more than you can eat, and it's located near a huge shopping mall. You are literally walking distance to a huge mall with international brands and restaurants. You are also close to the airport and most business areas.The design of the room takes some getting used to. The toilet is smack in the middle of the room separated by frosted glass only.All in all a safe and convenient hotel for Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Being in here with friends for a brief vacation. This is a five-star hotel so all facilities you'll get are something that you should get. Free wi-fi, television with cable channel, air conditioner, nice bathroom (with bath tub and shower), sofa. Clean but of course expensive for backpacker. The service is as expected from 5 stars hotel and above all, most of people who stayed in here is foreigners. Located at the heart of Jakarta, it's near the shopping centre (Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia). There is public transport stop right in front of the hotel, but as I said before, whoever stays in this hotel, I don't really believe they need it. So if you bring your own car, you need to find a parking space by yourself and believe me it will be a difficult task.After all, if this hotel suits your budget, book it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The staff here are probably the most friendly and attentive in any hotel I have visited. The service is exquisite and the hotel itself is extremely well groomed. There are refurbishments taking place that I have experienced the past 12 months whilst visiting regularly but the work is so well-organised, there is very little disturbance. The hotel is centrally located and most of the business areas are easily reached.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying in Pullman Hotel Thanrin Jakarta on weekend, as requested I was allowed to check in early at 9 AM and also late check out at 2 PM so I can enjoy my stay longer. Had chance to dine in at Sana Sini Restaurant and I have to say that it was a fantastic dining experience. Nice ambience and good food! Overall it was a relaxing and enjoyable weekens stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I got a good deal through Expedia for two nights at the Pullman Jakarta Hotel. Actually, I got a great deal. If you like shopping, this hotel is good for you. The Grand Indonesia Plaza and Thamrin City shopping centers are nearby. It takes about one hour to travel by taxi from the airport to Pullman Jakarta.Be forewarned, this hotel is popular with Japanese tourists and businessmen. It used to be known at Hotel Nikko and is close to the Japanese Embassy. If you happen to arrive at the same time as Japan Airlines, expect a long wait for check-in. That is my only complaint.My room was great. Despite having a room next to the street, my room was quiet. I used room service on one occasions, the food was great. Overall the staff was great and helpful.Since it is near Thamrin City, I plan to stay here again on my return trip in December.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Four nights in the new tower rooms. Absolutely loved it - the staff are extremely professional and friendly, nothing was too much bother. It was quiet - considering it is so close to central Jakarta - and an oasis to return to at the end of the day. The breakfast is outstanding, as is the buffet dinner. The restaurant staff were just lovely. All of the facilities were exactly what we needed and we will definitely return. Really comfy beds and a great bathroom. This is the best Pullman for a Jakarta stay - great shopping is within walking distance and it is right in the center of everything. Only 35 minutes to the airport - in the early morning....It is Jakarta and in peak time, you're never 35 minutes from anywhere! At peak times, you'll need an hour at least to the airport. Fantastic stay - loved Jakarta and loved the Pullman Thamrin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great stay in Jakarta - really good position from which to work, plus the added bonus of being so close to the big plaza's. Room was really comfy, Sana Sini was nice for both breakfast and dinner, and Kemixtri Gastro Bar good for a late night snack/tipple. All round a great place to relax after rushing around Jakarta all day, and a haven from the traffic!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Well. The room is relatively small compare with other same range hotels.service is just okay. maybe I should try other type of room when I visit Jakarta in August. I gotta shock when I step into the room. It just too small to believe..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel in a central Jakarta and in a middle of business and shopping area. Have a nice swimming pool, Gym and they have hot and cold whirlpool plus the Spa there is not bad, worth a try.Must try The SanaSini & Khayangan Restaurant, very recommended.But the hotel dont have kids club, there some space near swimming pool & Salon, if possible Pullman consider to build some children facility there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the location and nearby everything. Really in the hub of Jakarta ( Bunderan Thamrin, nearby Monas, big fancy mall like Grand Indonesia, Menteng area and other interesting tourist spot for Jakarta ) I can see gorgeous night view of Jakarta from this hotel.A modern and nice room, nice facility for swimming, sauna, fitness. I enjoy every minute of my short stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at Pullman Jakarta for 2 nights. I traveled as a family together with my parent in laws, my sis in law and my wife. My dad in law is wheelchair bound; but from the time we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff are very friendly; they helped me with pushing the wheelchair all the way till our room.The rooms: they're spacious, clean, and well-kept. Perfect!The breakfast spread is unbelievably yummy! From international food to the local food (that includes very traditional Indonesian food like porridge; some desserts) - breakfast is definitely too notch.Before Pullman Hotel Jakarta, the site was occupied by Niko hotel (a Japanese hotel). Thus, it still carries the good stuff about japanese: service staff are efficient, there's jap breakfast choice available in the morning and the cleanliness of the hotel is WOW!Will definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I'm in Jakarta! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're not from the area, or have never been to Jakarta before, this hotel will suit you well.From the moment you enter the hotel property thru the tiny back gate, as shuttering the front gate does wonders...you're greeted by the surely security who, each and every time they see you, will insist on a 'body check' before they allow your entrance. Living in Jakarta, I can attest that the pullman goes above and beyond with this show of security theater.Once inside the grand lobby, and up the lift to your room, you'll notice it's small for the price you pay. Furnishings are acceptable but not that of what you would like expect for a 4 or 5 star hotel, and some fixtures are beginning to show their wear.My biggest complaint comes from the lack of privacy displayed by the staff, specifically related to those ever present "do not disturb" signs. Apparently if you don't allow them in your room on their schedule on a daily basis, they will take it upon themselves to call, and call and call and then knock on your door to wake you up to ensure that "you are okay".Just a total bizarre experience, having this happen more than on occasion. Honestly I cannot recommend this hotel. The location is great, but for a 1/3 of the cost check out the new Holiday Inn Express down the street for comparable sleep quality. The Pullman Central Park is almost light years ahead of this property.If you're staying on business, and have no choice, then well this hotel may suit you just fine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel exceed my expectations. It was my first time on the Pullman brand hotel's and I thought it was a "business" hotel with average service and comfort but I was really well impressed by this hotel in Jakarta. Service was very good and the restaurant at the hotel offered an amazing number of options for breakfast and dinner with Indonesia, Japanese, Chinese and Western buffet. Food was not amazing, but very good. The room was also very comfortable, so was the pool and spa.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best breakfast I have ever had in my life. This hotel offers such a huge variety. Almost impossible. Excellent guys.Staff : superb service !!! Forgot my mobile in the Silver Bird Taxi. Within half an hour I had it back. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had an easy check in. While room was not overly spacious, it worked well and sufficient for a few nights stay. Tried out the gym. While everything was good and in working order, the way to the gym was a little confusing through a series of corridors. Only gripe is the shower where the water pressure was weak. Otherwise, location of the hotel was good and rooms are comfortable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location - downtown with 2 shopping malls on the other side of the road. Sizeable room with with a big hot tub. Breakfast offers the most choices that I have ever seen :) Quick check-in and check-out.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Good: Bags were scanned and i was to empty my pocket when the metal scanner detected the cellphone. Location wise was good, right smack in the CBD area, Wifi was strong, even better than my 3G sim card that i bought at the airport. Swimming pool was decent enough and the massage is awesome. The Not so good: Toilet was small, Suspect that i was given a different type of room from my booking. Lack of wall socket for charging was anotherThe Bad:Although they had a wide spread of food, they were cold and not fresh. And i found a hair in the chocolate tart. A complain to the staff and they didn't apologised and it seems that it was common, from the way the staff replied me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably the best located hotel in central Jakarta. Right opposite Plaza Indonesia, nearby Grand Indonesia mall, good for foods, shopping, etc.Free wifi across the building; gym with many equipment, amazing; small swimming pool though.Room was very clean. Big shower room with bathtub provided. HOWEVER, when I tried to fill up the bathtub, I then realized that the water is very dirty, yellowish in color. I left the water in the tub overnight, and I can see soil particles sunk down to the bottom. Not good.They provide few type of pillows for your selection, you may call up housekeeping to request them, FREE. So far, not many hotels doing that.It is quite far from the airport thought. If you are taking taxi to go airport, ask them to arrange/call a regular taxi, Blue Bird taxi. It is about half of the price than taking the luxury taxi, Silver Bird taxi, that lining up in the hotel.Having said that, I will not hesitate to go back to the same hotel if I am visiting Jakarta again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is strategically located in Jakarta CBD area. Very friendly staff with recently nice renovated spacious hotel lobby, makes it a good start to whole staying experience. Though a welcome drink would be a compliment, while guest is awaiting for check-in.The room is very spacious, nicely decorated with modern fittings.Breakfast choices have just been upgraded into another new level. The dining room service, in contrast, I was hoping that the choices could be more.Fitness and Wellness centre, a-we-some... Do not give a feeling that you are staying the centre of Jakarta busiest district.All in all, it is a nice hotel to stay in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Me and my little family (my husband and my son) had a great time at our stay at Pullman. If you want to be pampered with a comfortable stay, I recommended this hotel. Lots of my friends recommended us to stay in another hotel but we preferred the location and ambience of this hotel and the additional service was worth it. It was really an amazing experience as every thing was up to my expectation. I extremely appreciate the way they welcome the guest. So you feel you are really VIP guest. The room was spacious and elegant. I will come back for sure. I'm in love with this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm welcome, express check in, room super spacious with beautiful view to Jl Tamrin,. Bathroom equipped with the latest equipment , full range of upscale amenities. Delicious food at the restaurant and delightful bakeries.Clean pool, fully equipped fitness center and spa.A real gem in the heart of Jakarta , just two minutes walking to Plaza Indonesia by a pedestrian bridge.Thanks for the great hospitality, we will be back soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is ideally located in the heart of JKT. The rooms are totally refurbished and come with modern fittings. The breakfast is a feast in itself. Love the modern look of the entire hotel. Will surely be one of the first options for all future trips.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic location, great service, clean room, heavenly breakfast. The buffet breakfast was really the highlight of my stay! I could simply walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. Will definitely recommend this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the main centre area of Jakarta City. The hotel atmosphere was nice and friendly staff are really welcoming us. The room was spacious and furnished well. Other facilties such as the swimming pool is big, kids were enjoying it. Surrounding the hotel we can find shopping mall and Jakarta Landamark "Tugu Selamat Datang" (Welcoming Statue). We're really having a good time staying here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spent 4 nights at Pulmann hotel: what a great surprise! The hotel has been recently renovated and it is very modern. My room at 14th floor was just perfect: spacious, elegant and refined. Shower was amazing and the bathroom impeccable. Breakfast is amazing with a quasi infinite choice of fresh and backed food from the four corner of the world. In a word, a great stay and support for a work visit. Highly recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pure luxury. Flawless. Stayed here on business for 3 nights in early June 2014. It's in the CBD opposite Plaza Indonesia Mall and surrounded by offices and other 5 star international brand hotels. One of the staff told me it was built in the 1970's and then became part of the Nikko group before becoming part of Accor in the late 2000's. It was refurbed in 2011 or 2012 I think and looks brand new.The rooms are enormous and fantastically well equipped. Free wifi was provided and there are numerous power outlets and connections for the business traveller.The public areas are luxurious and very spacious. There a really cool bar serving cocktails and we had some lovely indonesian food for lunch one day in the lobby restaurant (Sana Sani I think). But it was the breakfasts that really blew us away. The quality and variety of food was superb. On the third day I was finding food stations that I didn't know existed. Give yourself enough time to enjoy, if you can.Staff were very helpful and friendly.Seemingly like all major hotels, shopping malls, offices and public buildings in Jakarta, security is very tight in the hotel. Expect airport style scanners and bag searches.I didn't use the pool but my son did and was very impressed. I did have a massage however which was excellent and at £30 for an hour was exceptional value.I would stay here again without hesitation if returning to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

attractive location- ample taxis available bu could get pretty hectice after office hoursfantastic city view from the grand deluxe rooms especially the traffic free day on Sundaynice bathroom with good showerthe hotel is very clean, well designed looked modern and chic.However, there appears to be several lounges at the same floor which appears empty and unutilised. good breakfast at the coffeehouse but nothing much for vegetarians. Some Indian menu would be good.thumbs up to the staffs- incredibly friendly and attentive. they keep the hotel going. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was in this hotel for 2 nights, i must say i was impressed by the overall fast check in services, great breakfast, central location and contemporary interior ambient. Not only is it appealing but comfortable too. Most of the positive reviews have already mentioned, but just to add, the strategic location near to Grand Indo and Plaza Indo is a plus point for me and any travellers as it's very convenient. As long as we don't have to travel far or get stuck in traffic jams for all the activities, is a blessing!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for 2 nights ..Nice hotel with professional service and great pool.Shopping malls are near bay in a walking distance..The breakfast is outstanding.It was a good and relaxing experience. Thank you
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel used to be Nikko Hotel, its located right in the heart of Jakarta. Hotel room is small but comfortable, bed was okay, pillow etc also just okay. They ahve Swim pool, Gym, Jacuzzi, Sauna and steam, i would say its a perfect escape after a long day in crowded Jakarta. Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia is just step away. the only contra is breakfast was lot better when its managed by Nikko.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very well situated and central hotel. Excellent service with really great staff who want to make you feel at home. Several European and American hotels could take this as an example. Free WiFi and good food all at good value round off the experience. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The huge lobby gives access to 2 towers, meaning the Pullman Jakarta is a big one ! A nice service and care even though some processes are pretty slowing the reception desk activities. The rooms are well decorated and modern art in the aisles is really appealing. On the negative side, some technical issues, bathroom showers are easy to deal with, but he staff is anyway helpful to arrange & fix everything. I haven't tried the nice outdoor pool as it closes daily at 7pm, a bit early...Overall a very good place for a business stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Was very pleasantly surprised by the fantastic new look throughout the hotel. Room was great and felt very new and fresh. Have sayed at this location since it was the Nikko but must say this was the nicest stay.Proximity to some great malls just across the road means it it not necessary to get caught up in traffic to have a wonder and a decent meal.Would recommend this hotel to business and family travellers alike.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You will be greeted warmly upon arrival, swift check-in process, efficient porter service, excellent room condition (I just could not detect a flaw to this property). As a female traveller, the room provides good quality of basic amenities that I require. Excellent location and just walking distance to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. Ample of taxis on standby at the front lobby. Nice pool. Reasonably priced for the awesome hospitality experience. I will definitely return to this property again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is definitely a very nice address in Jakarta.Close to many interesting locations, shopping malls, restaurant ...The different bars and restaurant at the hotel are extremely interesting and a perfect place to spend good timesThe staff have been nice and kind and very careful for the guestsThis was perfect
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run on sunday morning, please choose Pullman Thamrin. The Hotel is right place. You wake up on 5.30, run on track (car free day every sunday in Jakarta). You can choose alternatives breakfast beside buffet hotels. Thank you Pullman, we will choose it again for New Year Eve, and looking fireworks from Bundaran HI. Cayoooo ... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for two nights during the weekend, hotel overall cleanliness spotless even with some renovation happening in house. Kudos to housekeeping. Staff at front office were all very courteous and helpful. Security to enter the hotel very tigh for someone travelling from Kuala Lumpur to witness but it is the standard in Jakarta. Food was great, specially breakfast where the restaurant features full ranges of international buffet. If you checking out on Sundays in your travel itinerary, check with front office if there were car free Sunday happening. You may got stuck with no taxi to take your to the airport from 0700 to 1000 hrs. Otherwise very wonderful and splendid hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This stay is my 3rd in this fantastic hotel. The experience starts when you arrive at the hotel, when you are greeted by the concierge. They take the trouble to check that you have not left anything behind in the airport taxi. Check in was fast and pleasant and the phrase "welcome back sir" , is always nice to hear, and it make you feel really welcome. Took the Deluxe room, with the king size bed, and it is very comfortable. The bathroom came with separate bath and toilet. The bathtub was a waste for me. Wi-Fi was reasonable and easy to sign on. It comes with a coffee making machine. The room comes with dual air con control.Breakfast was at the "Sana Sini" restaurant and they have a wide variety of food. The hotel is located in a good location with large shopping malls nearby. The hotel has a very nice gym, spent a couple of hours working out and enjoyed the sauna.Kemxtri is a nice place to have informal meeting.Overall a very enjoyable stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here on several occasions and for weeks. Pullman is a great business hotel being in the primary business district. The rooms are nicely decorated and well equipped. Breakfast and dinner at their restaurant in the lobby is wide in choice and good. And you are literally 2 minutes away from places to eat and great shopping.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I love to stay here because the room is quite big, bathtub and what I love most is the swimming pool....My son love to be there because he can watch tv while relaxing in thw bath tub....Cant wait to be there again next July...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The wifi was good in my room. The shower and bathrooms are new and the hardware is high end. The breakfast is excellent buffet style with fresh fruits, Asian and western fare. Pullman at Jalan MH Thamrin 59 is across the street from a mall where many restaurants and a supermarket can be found. The hotel fare is very reasonable for the amenities. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very dirty bathroom floor, not being cleaned with attention. Stuffy room with bad odor on the carpet and cigarete smell from central air con system. Its a non smoking room with bad smell. Will not stay in this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What I liked about this hotel is that it's surrounded by $350+ hotels (Hyatt, Kapenski, Mandarin, Keraton,) and it was half the price yet feels just like those 5 star hotels. Staff was so friendly and warm. My wife meet a school friend of hers in the Kemistri bar, its a smoking lounge as a well coffee/bar. Should you be in the mood for a smoke, well they sell Cuban cigars at half the price the cigar store in Plaza Indonesia sells them for. We had the new deluxe room which over looked the pool, so that meant NO NOISE FROM THE TRAFFIC outside. The floor still smelled like new carpet, there is a HUGE bathtub in the bathroom, two shower heads, a rain fall as well as the kind on a cord. Four bt of water to drink as well as gourmet coffees and teas to drink. I didn't use the facilities but did notice a clean sparking pool that hardly anyone used. My one and ONLY complaint would have to be their breakfast, horrible selection of items. Eggs cooked to order is great, but not when there are 15 people waiting for the one person to cook them, There are NO Asian selections, and maybe 7-8 item in all and then cold cereal and pastries. Pass on the bfast if you can, just get the internet which is lightning fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I heard the hotel was quite recently renovated. The hotel lobby certainly looks new, clean and spacious. The gym and pool facilities are not bad. Rooms are clean but it is abit on a small side. It is smaller than other hotels I have been to.Staff are exccellent. They are competent and friendly. Will definitely stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very good hotel and the staff are excellent. The rooms are pleasant and well thought out in design.However, what stands out is the food and drink. The first time I went into the restaurant I almost got lost wandering around the different food stalls. The food is very good, though be prepared for a sizable bill.Even the coffee bar in the lobby is first class, serving many different varieties and as ever, the staff are excellent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for 1 night at the end of our short break in indonesia.The location was right in the centre of jakarta. The inner look of the hotel, was grand. Checked in was smooth, at the Le accor priority desk. After a bad experience at Novotel Bangka, I'm happy that Pullman Jakarta acknowledged me as a platinum Le Accor member. We were given a welcome letter with all the platinum member benefits. This hotel definitely read all the previous constructive reviews and did something about it. We received the VIP treatment that previous reviewers complained it was missed by the hotel.We booked the grand deluxe room located at the new tower. We absolutely loved it. Spacious, luxurious, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was a worldly delicious affair. Brit/American, Continental, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian... you name it. You probably could skip lunch and dinner after breakfast at Sana Sini restaurant!All the staff were super friendly, from the security, doorman, concierge, cleaning service, front desk...One suggestion, the pool area could have given a new look, as it looked a bit tired.Definitely will stay here again in Jakarta. Hopefully they will keep the excellent service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been staying in this hotel for four years, while it was being renovated, and in the past year, the past 6 months in particular, have seen a dramatic increase in quality of this hotel A major improvement has been the opening of a new restaurant in the lobby - the Sana Sini. The old restaurant was so bad that I used to spend every evening across the street at the conveniently located Plaza Indonesia, eating in one of the many restaurants and bars located there. The food quality in the new restaurant, however, is very good. The buffet (breakfast and dinner) is huge, and well presented with a number of different stations for western, Indian, Indonesian, Chinese and Japanese specialties, and the evening a la carte menu produces some surprisingly good fish, chicken, steak and Indonesian food. I have also received some good advice on wine from the resident wine expert. The hotel has a functioning fitness centre with multiple high-tech devices, a swimming pool and a spa. The Kem Mixtry bar in the lobby is a bit dark, but there is an airy coffee shop (Le Chocolat) in the lobby which has a very good selection of white and green tea. The major deficiency now, is the absence of a business centre. The lobby area's communications hub is OK for casual communication if you have forgotten your laptop, or for children to play in, but the hotel needs a professional business centre. For Club Accor members, it is worth noting that there is not yet an Executive Club, but there are Executive rooms, and Platinum members and those in Executive rooms get complimentary access to the bar for a few hours each night. But the heart of the improvement is the staff who are not just attentive, but genuinely friendly - in the restaurant, at the front desk, at the door,among the large number of security personnel, and particularly the concierge and guest services, who have been able to assist me on several trips. You don't get this level of attentiveness without good management, and the managers are on the floor making sure things work.This hotel still has some minor improvements to make - but given what it has accomplished, and the dramatic changes over the past four years, I am looking forward to seeing what comes next. Right now, given the location, the presence of a really large number of Silver Bird taxis available all the time, it is good for casual stays and for business trips where we don't really have a need for a business centre. I am told this is in the next phase of the renovations, along with an Executive Lounge.But all in all, this is really a rapidly improving hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff, and one to which I will be returning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Second time staying here. The renovations to lobby and restaurants have made a great hotel outstanding.The breakfast selection was probably the biggest I've seen anywhere in the world for the variety of cuisine. I also enjoyed the bakery cafe, and the cool atmosphere in the bar.I don't use many hotel gyms but this one was outstanding. If it wasn't so hot outside I would probably have used the pool area that looked quite enticing.If you want to stay in this particular area, but don't want to spend a fortune I would pick the Pullman every time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed there in Pullman Thamarin and it was my first experience with PULLMAN brand of hotels. I was on a business trip and happened to taste the experience of both the standard room and the grand deluxe room for 1 night each. Rooms are well equipped with all basic amenities that you need. If size of standard room is BIG, I would say that the size of grand deluxe room is GRAND. Personally if I would left the hotel after staying in standard room, I would have rated this hotel a 4; but the kind of room they have as Grand deluxe, I have no words but to rate it as 7 star deluxe room. Bathrooms are pretty big. Deluxe room has both bath tub and separate shower area.Bar is good with good options and happy hour. Breakfast/ dinner buffet are huge but lack vegetarian options. Coffee shop is good with numerous bakery options.Location of the hotel is pretty good and opp to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia mall.Spa facility is good but expensiveFor my Indian friends, there is an indian restaurant in the building next to this hotel (in the LG floor)Overall all, out an out good value for money
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very contemporary rooms with beautiful views of the skyscrapers on Thamrin and the fountain. The breakfast buffet is to die for. Bathrooms could be a little bigger though.Overall a great experienceWould love to return 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I love to stay in this hotel because its so central and near to everywhere. Nice view of Jakarta and i can walk to Plaza Indonesia or Grand Indonesia. Pullman has nice Lobby area and very good restaurant. One thing is that the room smells not so good, strong cigarette smell... and as a stay guest, they give me discount to Spa and Salon, but unfortunately very fluctuating... one day i got 20%, 2 days more i got only 10%, and in the end of my stay i got no discount! so wierd... the Spa is nice and i love to go there, but i always wondering how much i pay in the end :DD they should actually give more information to the guest, dont play too much with us please :)but i think i will comeback again to Pullman Thamrin, i just love the place!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We always enjoy our stay at Pullman Thamrin...with the room, the breakfast..the facilities...location was good. My daughter said,hope in the next visit there will be a Kids Club at your hotel...keep it excellent...  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spent a couple of nights at this property during a recent business trip to Jakarta. The service was excellent and the check-in process was prompt.The staff in the restaurant was extraordinarily attentive and the food was good.My room was clean and comfortable.The fitness center is well equipped and relatively large.Overall, this hotel is a great option located right in the middle of the Jakarta business district.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here in the month of April for a quick 2 day trip. The hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport and on a Friday evening, we didnt face much traffic.On check-in, we asked to see the bigger room and they were kind enough to show it to us and escort us there. Just a marketing tip - If they had shown me the big room first and then the standard room, I would have taken the big one for sure!Check in was a breeze. The room is nothing big, but it has all amenities one needs, and the internet works like a charm in the room! We had a meal at the restaurant in the hotel, and it was excellent. We did not have the buffet but had a look and it looked extremely big and lavish. We ordered room service as well and the food came quick and was hot. We asked for restaurant recommendations around the hotel and they were kind enough to call and check if the restaurant was open.We used the spa in the hotel as well, and the services were very good and reasonably priced.Would definitely stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent service and good price except breakfast, Large room and nice views from the window, comfortable bathroom although this time the hand-shower device leaked wáter.Very important internet runs well.   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice place in the center of Jakarta City which have a lot of luxury facility will make you comfortable and enjoy your day.Taxi facility is lux one and also best facility at the room makes stayable in the room a whole day
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was nice, i got a deluxe room. The room and bathroom were literally huge, the amenities were beyond expected. Service was OK, the check in process was fast and efficient. Breakfast was excellent, there were many stations for breakfast.The only downfall was the lift. the last time I came, I had to climb the stairs to 2nd floor to get to my room since the lifts were renovated. this visit, I had to go to 1st floor then climb to 2nd floor to go to the pool and gym. So i did not go swimming at all. I guess next time the management better renovated the lifts one at a time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed three nights at this Hotel on a Business trip. The staff could not have been more helpful. The room was well fitted out, clean and tidy.Meals were excellent, overall a great Hotel and one to stay in while in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was conveniently located opposite Plaza Indonesia Shopping mall, linked by an overhead bridge outside of the hotel. The room we had (Grand deluxe with King Size bed) was spacious and very clean. We could hear slight renovation noises from where we were (Level 8) when we returned to the hotel in the afternoon, but did not quite bother us as we were really satisfied with the room. There was a card for pillow selection, but we did not choose any.Breakfast spread was good, with chinese, japanese, continental, indian selections to choose from. Drinks selections included Dilmah Teas, fresh fruit juices, smoothies, and coffees. Was really spolit for choice when we had breakfast on the first day. But from the second day onwards, was rather tired of the breakfast spread as it was almost exactly the same.Room was not made up on the second day after we returned from shopping, however after we informed the reception of our requirement for housekeeping, we were happy when we returned with our room cleaned up. Not sure if it was because we did not put the sign for them to come back later for house keeping (we had the 'Do Not Disturb' lights on), but we did hanged the 'Pls make up room' prior to leaving the hotel. But as everything was back to normal when we returned the second time, we were fine with it.Internet connection was fast and good, however it was a little troublesome that everytime we had to use the phone, we needed to log in again. Left some of our belongings in the hotel when we checked out, but hotel staff was very honest and when we called back and emailed hotel, they kept it at the lost and found for us. We did retrieve it back in the end and was really glad. THUMBS UP!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you notice when you travel to jakarta is that the 5 star hotels are sooo expensive! Compared to Bangkok and KL, you can pay up to 3 times the price of a similar hotel in Jakarta. So when we visited the Pullman at Thamrin for the first time it was a surprise. The hotel is still partly under renovatio, but the main areas have been transformed very nicely. We booked a deluxe room which was in the new building and up to modern standards. The breakfast was great. You had everything you could ask for ranging from local Indonesian dishes to Japanese food and interntaional breakfast favourites. Furthermore the location is great, right across large malls and on Sunday you can even join the locals on their morning walk or cycle tour around the Bunderan HI. The only thing that could be renovated is the swimming pool area, which is a bit boring and standard compared to other hotels in the area, such as Kempinski Jakarta. All in all, very good value for money!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been here a lot of times. The biggest reasons are the good location they have, also the price is very acceptable especially for having the 5* experience.The last time I stayed at the hotel (around April 2014), it has been renovated and has a much better ambiance and felt more luxury.I love the new lobby, bigger than when it was located in the second floor. I always love the smell, i wonder what brand they use. I would like to have the same smell in my house.The room is not the part they renovated. Not really big, but just fine for me. I love the suite room (I used this type in my previous stay). The suite is spacious and has nice living room concept.The most favorite part for me always the pool. Pullman has big pool, yet quiet so I enjoy it a lot. Eventhough the pool has no specific view, but that's fine for me.The indoor jacuzzi was also nice and add the value of my stay.The park was bit far, and I didn't see any valet stand by, so I need to bring my luggage by myself.Most of all, I love stay here. The service was actually not too personally engage, but i took it as the space they given to enjoy my personal time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was well greeted the moment I arrive at the hotel. The ambience was great and service was good.However, I was caught up at the checking in counter as they charged me wrongly based on the bookings I've made and I have to top up at the end of my stay. However, I was informed upfront by the staff so I was aware of the top up. However, I thought this could be waived but I still paid for it at the end of my stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My second time staying at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia (ex-Nikko Hotel). I am very impressed with the newly renovated wing of the hotel. Compared to the first time staying at the hotel, the rooms in the new wing are modern and cozy. Check in was fast and efficient, front office staff are very professional. The hotel is walking distance to Plaza Indonesia (hopefully I got it right). It is connected by a overhead bridge. Breakfast, there are huge variety of food to select from. As it is easter during that time, there are a lot of activities at the lobby of the hotel, especially for kids. Very creative activities. If you would like to access to other place, taxis are readily available at the hotel, usually I would recommend Blue Bird or Silver Bird. Silver Bird is more premium and they always on standby at the hotel. Both are going by meter. However, do take note of the toll charges so that they don't overcharge on that aspect (toll is charged separately). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

pullman thamrin is located right in the center of jakarta. so easy to get you everywhere, especially in jakarta`s traffic. i especially love the japanese breakfast in pullman which I dont find in any other hotels :)  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at this hotel for a very short period (1 night, and was there from 8pm til 6am) during March 2014 and not have a change to try out the restaurants or fitness facilities. I just experienced checkin, my room and checkout. The foyer area is immaculately presented. When I arrived I was told I had an upgrade, and indeed my room was large, modern and extremely nicely finished and did not feel like a typical boring business hotel room. And the checkout was speedy and without incident, my car to the airport being ready exactly when requested. My rate was really good too. I would stay here again
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A very nice Hotel in Jakarta and bang opposite a large mall. Positives were the Grand Lobby, fantastic staff, the restaurant and the selection it offered, the facilities and the location. Not so positives were offering a smoking room and I was not willing to wait for them to get a non-smoking room ready as Jakarta traffic is not for the faint hearted. I took it anyway as when I inspected the room the room nor the corridor smelt, so thumbs up! I will stay again!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My stay at the Pullman Hotel was pleasant. My room was a bit small but having a deep bath to soak in made up for it. The bed was comfortable and the staff were helpful and friendly. It is directly across the road from one of the biggest shopping centres in Jakarta - Grand Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first stay here is perfect.This is my 2nd stay, let me give you a list what ruin my stay1. The check in counter didnt give me an upgrade for my room even-though I already stated that Im platinum member. Reason being, upgrade based on availability. After turning on the internet, I found out that room for upgrade IS available. Go back to receptionist, and they upgrade me2. I bought executive floor room. Turns out that the executive lounge is being renovated, and was being informed that I can use the bar based on the same privileges only from 1800-2000 (2 hours only!). Imagine that! Pay extra money to use 2 hours Executive lounge privileges!3. Breakfast time, already send my bfast voucher during check in. Every-time I go for breakfast, they ask me to show my membership card. What for??After checking out, I wrote a long complaint letter and was being responded.Just found out, that executive floor privileges can be used in other bar. This was never informed to me before... for the whole stay.... This is a step back from what used to be an excellent 5 stars standard of Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay for one night only and feels sad because I think that I should stay longer...I choose the Deluxe Room since I already experienced the Standard Room, very surprised when entering the room because it was so different with the standard one...It was perfectly great room and you'll not regret it. Very nice room, comfortable, fresh and modern ambiance. Good food, great service when having a dinner at the restaurant. Great taste, affordable price and the waiter are very helpful, skilful and friendly, his name was Angga (find him and he will give you a good suggestion and a pleasant service). Absolutely will come back again
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a great stay in Pullman Tharmin 28 weeks ago. However this trip proves otherwise......Checked in around close to midnight on Thurs;1) Was informed they were unable to give a room upgrade. (I am an accor club Gold member). The receptionist informed that I have to pay to get a double upgrade. Many times Accor Hotels have offered more than a double upgrade without extra charge. This didn't happened during my last trip. Why the double standard???!!!2) Cut my finger in the elevator. Nothing really serious though. Requested for handyplasts from front desk. However, I'm surprise they didn't even bothered to find out how it happened and it may in future be a hazard to other guests. 3) Requested for a late checkout of 4pm on Sunday. After checking, the receptionist told me I have to pay 50% roomrate for the late checkout. However, I told her i was elligible for late checkout she then said it was ok. I requested to speak to the duty manager. He apologised and offered to arrange for a complimentary transfer to the airport. I declined him eventually as to show him that these complains are not to claims freebies from the hotel. I only want to enjoy what's entiltled to me by Accor Hotel which Pullman Thamrin failed this time.Otherwise, I reckon it's generally still a good hotel however managed by some not to par staff.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We really enjoy the room, the facilities, and the service. The staff are very helpful and courteous. The hotel is strategically located close to shopping mall and business districts. The breakfast is good and offers different choices.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect location to see mid Jakarta, surrounding of shopping center,nice pool and new look restaurant,their food very nice, my kids enjoy the swimming pool, nice place to gateway from hectic of Jakarta   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time here. Why I choose this hotel because we would like to be in car free day on Sunday and they have special price for weekend if we reserved online. First, when we are check in, the queue is a little bit too lon i guess, even they are already 4 tables for the recepsionist. And, we have to wait around 30 minutes for our room to get ready. Because we are using car, so we ask for free parking and the concierge said that it will be until check out. But, what is happening when we are already in front of the gate, they said that my car number is not listed and we have to ask for more free parking. And behind us is already a lot of cars. And I have to go back to concierge to ask for more free parking, and it takes around 10 minutes for me to wait for that. So annoying, because we as the guest have to ask for that. Can't it taking care by the concierge...? What an annoying experience...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed at the Pullman Jakarta for 4 nights on a business trip. I was a bit nervous because the reviews suggested the standard rooms weren't very nice. However, I was pleasantly surprised (I almost considered upgrading to the new deluxe rooms, but didn't find it necessary) - the room was perfectly nice. The gym is one very good and I had a great massage in the spa. I was too lazy to leave the hotel for dinner, and my meals were all pretty good. Service was friendly across the board, but lacked polish - generally not a problem except when one of the concierge staff somehow convinced a taxi driver to take me to a meeting. frustrating for him and me because he didn't know the way and we were very late. The other complaint is that I found the pillows incredibly uncomfortable and I pretty much tried every pillow on the pillow menu - too high for me. I don't get a huge hotel budget for work hotels and thought this was a good option - I'll definitely stay here again, but maybe next time i'll bring my own pillow.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman is perfectly placed to visit the Grand Indonesia shopping centre etc. It is right outside the centre of action for Car Free Day each Sunday. We stayed in the new section, excellent rooms. Service was quick and attentive and breakfast was very good. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

stay in this hotel for 4-5 times in last 2 years, but my last stay is really impress me.the renovation on the Lobby is done, the new lobby is open, very spacious and comfortable with great staff which never stop smiling and offer to help. its also great place to set meeting with your business partner, the atmosphere is great.the negatives only you have to walk far from the receptions to the room lift because of very huge lobby and lift placed on the left corner.i choose the hotel because the location is in the central of Jakarta and near 2 famous shopping mal in Jakarta. the shopping mal just across the street and you can reach it by max 5 minutes walk from the hotel.this hotel also have cheaper price to compare with other 3 hotels around the famous HI Circle which 2 of it is an OLD hotel!.i stay at the grand deluxe room, it is very nice room, new, clean, spacious and quiet.only the room door is very heavy.the breakfast place is on right side lobby, so you can imagine to walk from the lift which is on the left corner of the lobby to the right corner to have breakfast. but the good news is, it is worth with the walk. the breakfast menu is very complete : indonesian, western, japan, chinese, indian all serve with good taste.you can find TWG tea stand right before the breakfast place which also offer cake and bread (start 6pm, the cake and bread is discount 50 percent).will stay here again
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy my stay in this hotel as customer service always ready to help either check in or reserve taxi. Staff can remember my name that i let me feel warm. I like the amenities and they always provide extra.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a really good hotel. The lobby is huge. I booked in the "new" rooms where my friend booked regular one. It seems the regular ones are small and old. My room was really big and totally modern with stand up shower and separate toilet. Big size king bed.However room service was so-so. I had to call 3 times to have my laundry picked up. And oh yea, laundry closes at 7:00PM, so if you need your suits and shirts done and get it early following morning..well not a chance. Fortunately I had a another suit ;-)

I have experienced an amazing night at Pulman Thamrin Jakarta. I got no difficulties in booking. I got helps and nice conversation from room services to bring my luggages to my room. One thing which made me impressed is the pool. I swam in the afternoon without any disturbance and it was very comfortable. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is in the business town district. very huge choice for breakfast within 3 restaurants. Beautiful fitness and Swimming pool area. Rooms are nice and clean not very large but big enough. There is a nice business area. employees are very kind.it is located near the most famous shopping area of the town. the restaurants are very good and cheaper then other in the same area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A luxury hotel that seems very over the top as you enter. However the room is smaller than expected, however the in room wifi is fast and the facilities are excellent. First time I have had a shower could hear the TV through the bathroom speaker and watch the TV through the glass bathroom wall.Good hotel would stop again.....however have not eaten here
-------------------------------------------------------------------

High end hotel with security. This pace is perfectly decorated with modern fixtures and whimsical art. We stayed in a 2 room suite that was spacious, incredibly comfortable, and had 2 small foyers with separate access doors. Didnt get to enjoy breakfast but front desk provided to-go boxes of pastries for our traveling party.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All the good experience staying in this hotel (nice room, hospitality of the staff) were all anticlimaxed by the parking lot service. After i processed my free parking, in the gateway they asked me to wait for around 20 minutes, before finally asked me to go back to Guest Relation Officer!!!Its due to unsuccesful link between the hotel system and parking system., and it happened to many guests. My suggestion: please use the conventional approach..use voucher paper for free parking. It works in many of other hotels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great location just walking distance from popular malls and some cool little restaurant / bars.I stayed twice in the last fortnight and enjoyed my stay very much both times.Very friendly and professional staff. Impressive breakfast buffet. Multiple lounge / bar areas to host meetings or sit with a wine or coffee.Nicely renovated, very clean and although rooms are compact they are cleverly designed. Love the little couch and writing desk - really a perfect room for business with a bit of leisure time in between the work hours.The gym was really really good. Many machines, nice outdoor view, great steam, sauna and spa room.The thing I loved the most was the fresh flowers everywhere. As you walk into the foyer you can smell fresh flowers. Really a nice touch and makes the world of difference when you spend most of your time in hotels... a breath of life! Thanks for a great stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time a a Pullman and I must say that I am somewhat impressed. Checking was quick and staff was friendly.Room was a bit on the small side (just barely enough to "swing a cat") with minimal space between the bed and other pieces of furniture. Saying that, it was well appointed, clean and functional. Bed was nice and firm and sleep quality was great.Was a bit disappointed that they did not have a business center. (Undergoing renovation) had to have my meeting at the coffee shop which had nice big tables. as it was well post lunch, it was sufficiently quiet and pick a nice private corner.Great breakfast selection but you have to navigate a maze to figure out what is on offer. Great exercise to work up an appetite. Once you pick up your food, your next challenge was to find your table.Nice hotel but which the room was bigger rooms though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am Platinum with LeClub but this hotel did a very poor job in recognizing their members. The problem starts before I even checked-in. They have a Priority Desk at reception - which was unattended at all ! The irony is, all the receptionists were attending other desks and when I pointed out to them that there SHOULD be someone at their own Priority Desk, they just shrugged and said, "It has never been attended anyway." Dear Philippe, if you are reading this, I wonder what sort of function you have a Priority Desk is for. I took photos of the empty Priority Desk, please see them (attached).So I queued and when they're checking me in, they told me that they don't have an Executive Lounge (never mentioned on the Accor website!) and they have no idea when they will have one, so they gave me a voucher for an orange juice that costs $5 at the bar (I checked the price). The worst thing is, they only gave ONE voucher for exactly ONE beverage, PER ROOM not per person, and PER STAY, not per night. I was with my wife (also LeClub Platinum) and we had a reservation for two nights, but they insist that they would only give me one voucher for one glass of beverage. Either take it or leave it. No fruit in the room either.The next morning at breakfast, I had to argue our way through just to be allowed entry to the restaurant. The restaurant staff did not even recognize my LeClub Platinum card when I showed it to them and they phoned the front desk. If I had known all this, I would not have stayed here but I already made two reservations paid upfront, so I still have one stay coming on April 18 and my expectation is very low for a pleasant stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here with my sister on 22 feb 2013, we stayed in deluxe room. the room was execellent, huge and nice bathroom. my first impression was good when i checked in, the front office staff very warm but check in process was slowly and when was checked out i had been inform to reception when i go down due to check out that room is already paid so don't asked any payment to my sister. i was little upset to hear from my sister that the staff asked the payment and my sister got confused,cause shes gonna be to airport so shes directly payment use debit BNI. means in here the staff is did not have clearly offer handle with previous shift.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Far from home (family in Europe), I was looking for a hotel where not to feel the distance. Pullman Jakarta has all I could think about, for a long term stay (longer than 4 weeks). The location is right the point where you need to live in Jakarta; very well connected with airport, business centres, main streets...and malls.. shopping centres, right on the other side of the street.Rooms are spacious, moderns and quite; recently renovated, have a great bathroom.The Staff of Pullman are one of the most valuable points to highlight. Just the second day of stay, they knew my name, most of them new I was there for some weeks... and after a "couple of breakfasts", the Staff knew what I used to have...really amazing. Among the best hotels in the world I stayed... Pullman has the best staff I ever met. You feel secure, also, within a high degree of privacy, which in Jakarta is a point to take into consideration.You also have a variety of services that make Pullman Hotel a unique experience: Restaurant, Pub, Fitness (one of the best equipped in Jakarta) and Spa, with many treatments to receive. The Staff in that area are outstanding, too. So kind and caring of your health.Mr. Philippe, Mr.. Aquino and the team (family) are doing a great and invaluable job. Thank to you all. I give you 5*****.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As with all Pullman Hotels it's clean & comfy ...loved the pool & sauna, steam & jacuzzi which you could use freely. One gripe was checkin ... We flew 8hrs and arrived early at 7.30am which I informed them of .... We knew we would have to wait for a room... But there were over 50 ppl checking out early and still no room available for us? Until I saw my niece sleeping in chair from exhaustion a few hours later made me storm over to the reception ,,, all of a sudden a room is available? I shouldn't have to storm over anywhere, one should appreciate that there is a family travelling! Anyway aside from that a good stay 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here with my friend, we stayed in grand deluxe room at 7th floor, nice with Bundaran HI view. The room was excellent, huge and beautiful bath room. My first impression was excellent when I checked in they welomed me warmly and check in process was quick , then the bell man also was excellent ,always ready to escort and inform everything about the facilities of the room. The pool was good and clean and also fitness centre was good .We were staying here on sunday so we enjoyed the car free day at Jl.Thamrin in the morning , it was light rain but we were excited to join the others to do some activities.Breakfast in Sana Sini restaurant was excellent, they had lots variety of food, and the foods was fresh. I loved their sushi and their dimsum, and also special thanks to all of staff in Le Chocolate for the birthday surprise even though my friend arranged that.Overall I loved my experience staying at pullman jakarta and highly recomended you for stay in Pullman Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is really cozy and modern in style. The dining experience was also great either dinner or breakfast. Great variety of food with very friendly and helpful servers. One lack thing was the water pressure from shower was weak, but it should not stop me from giving 5 stars to my stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here with my friend for the first time. Our first impression was average. There's no bell boy and no welcome drink. I've stayed at several 5 star hotel and this is the first time no drink was served to me. The room was nice. I like the bath room even the room was small. Too bad the AC was not cool enough so we called technician to repair it. The bad thing is we still stay in our room while wait the technician repair the AC. This is the 5 star hotel. The management should put us in another room while waiting. That's way I think Pullman should improve their SOP. But then the breakfast was very nice. They have so many various of food, and it's delicious. It also near to malls. Overall it's a nice hotel and I enjoy my visit. Will come again? If they improve SOP and service, I will. :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman might be the most affordable among the other five-star hotels on Bunderan HI, but doesn't necessarily means it's the lowest-end of all. I stayed at superior room, and found the room not really spacious, but it still had enough space for guests to move around. The bathroom had it all. Bath tub, shower, hot and cold sinks, and generous bath supplies. The fitness facilities were great. I personally really enjoyed spending time working out at the gym, followed by lap swims, sauna, steam, and plunging at the jacuzzi. The most important point of my review is the breakfast buffet at Sana Sini Restaurant. Sana Sini is currently one of the most popular restaurants in Jakarta to have buffet, and the variety of the food isn't reduced too much at breakfast time. Book the room with breakfast included, and don't skip the breakfast!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in Pullman last weekend, asking for early check in and also room with Thamrin view. The room was nice and clean. The location of this hotel is really strategic and near to shopping center (Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia). The buffet breakfast was delicious and vary, and the staffs were so helpful. What bothered me a little bit is when I took a bath in the morning, there's a small cockroach walking through the wall. I wish they can pay the attention for this bathroom cleanliness for the next time. And the last, Wifi connection was superbly fast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We had the newly refurbished grand deluxe room and it was immaculate. We felt really pampered with all of the amenities, free WIFI, great shower and bathtub plus TV with many satellite channels. You can choose several type of pillow to suit your needs. Just across the road is plaza indonesia and nearby is grand indonesia within walking distance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel provides a consistently high level of service for a (relatively) good price in Jakarta. Attentive service from the staff throughout. A good breakfast buffet choice and all in all a peaceful haven from the chaos of this mega city. The only thing I would improve is later opening hours for the pool and gym as after a long days work it would be nice to be able to use these facilities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lounge was in under renovation but didnt have alternative options and each staffs say differently. Pillow was very uncomfortable and bed seems quite old. heard 2nd oldest hotel in Jakarta, location wise very good but price and service wise....think other hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice and classy hotel with cosy ambience. The breakfast buffet has a great variety of food from the different cuisines and the quality is really good too. The only downside is that it is going through renovations now and I will need to change to another lobby on the ground floor in order to go to the pool. The spa and massage packages are very reasonably priced too. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am grateful with the service at the check in both on Sunday, 9 March and Thursday, March 13th 2014. Also I delightful with the steamed ginger drink prepared for me during buffet on Saturday, March 15th 2014.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to get the nice place, nice service, nice value and nice hotel, Pullman Jakarta Indonesia hotel is an answer. I will recomend this hotel for my friends and family/ You must proff it by yourself   
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time for me to stay in this hotel. In fact it has a great lobby, great rooms. The location of this hotel is fantastic, it is opposite plaza indonisia hotel and near grand indonisia mall. I really recommend it for shopping and business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good hotel in central Jakarta, close to a major shopping mall. The rooms are a good size and clean. The Tapas bar serves good food and drink which is excellent value. If you want something different you can go across the road to the shopping mall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At checkin, at 10:00pm, I was told I had a choice between a smoking room or a room that had just been painted and still smelled of paint....and I had to wait 15 minutes to see if it really was rid of the paint smell. Of course I had reserved a non-smoking room, so this was distressing. They made no attempt to rectify the situation.Upon entering my room, I found there was mold in the bathroom, the furnishings were worn and dirty. Since I had pre-paid the room, I had no choice but to stay. I will not make the same mistake again.Please note, this is NOT the Pullman near Central Park. Some of the reviews here are for that hotel, and I have no idea what that one is like. This is the one on Jalan Kebon Kacang Raya. Don't stay here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here last summer during the renovation and had a mediocre experience. Since the lobby and restaurant have been opened and the tower II rooms complete things have changed for the positive. The new room (be sure to specify new room) went for 209USD a night and was excellent in every way. Tasteful furnishings and spacious. Coffee maker with tea carafe as well. Huge bathtub and separate shower if you like. The lobby is a bit over the top but always filled with stylish people sipping coffee or going to a wedding. The restaurant breakfast buffet goes on and on and service is friendly and professional. Arrived late and had late dinner in non-smoking area of Chemistry Bar. Friendly service and interesting crowd with good food and wine selection. Gym and pool area excellent as well.If Pullman continues opening hotels like this I will stay with them in the future. Less pretentious than the Shangri La and Mandarin and more character and style than Hyatts and Marriotts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

one of the best location closed to the Mall and the french embassy building.Good food with variety of restaurants .The room was not a big space but the design was fantastic.We enjoyed being in the center close to many key locations .Service is also fantastic
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at the Pullman for business for 2 nights and was impressed with the high quality of service and facilities. Rooms were very stylish but also functional (good desk & lighting for work, international power plugs, good Wifi) and had lovely bathrooms. Restaurant was also a standout with a fantastic range of foods on offer at the breakfast buffet.I was also impressed with the quality and ambience (and price) of the spa.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is in the center and is convenient. If a road crossed,there is also ashopping center.The bread of the cafe on the first floor is also delicious.A pillow can also be chosen from several kinds and is very comfortable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know how to express my thanks to Pullman Thamrin, yesterday was my fourth stays there and I am really satisfy with all stays, for those great experience I decide to spend a bit of my time today to write this review.ROOM: very comfortable & spacious, great shower / tub. very nice view (Bundaran HI). some rooms even with proper kitchen.POOL: perfect way to enjoy swimming pool here, big enough to swim without get bump to others, with enough gazebo to lay lazy around the pool or enough long chair to get the sunbath.SERVICE: very helpful & friendly.LOCATION: exactly at the heart of Jakarta, with Plaza Indonesia & Grand Indonesia across the street, and other side with well known SABANG street hawker food, and a lot of delicious restaurants around there or nice cafe to hang around.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at the Pullman Jakarta Thamrin four times and each time, I am never dissapointed. It is a home away from home, which makes it the perfect base for my favourite vacation city. I have given the hotel the benefit of the doubt since my first stay back in May 2013 when they were still in a major phase of renovation and when I returned again in late December 2013, I have come to love this hotel more. Two visits in quick succession, in late January and last weekend in mid February has reinforced my liking of this sleek property. I will break down my review into a few sections for ease of reference.Check-in : Always efficient and expedient. I am normally in my room from check-in in less than five minutes.Room : Stayed in Deluxe during first stay and in Superior for subsequent stays. The rooms are very contemporary, smells good (similar to the smell in the lobby - I should have asked what air freshener / potpourri they use, it smells so nice) and complete with all the amenities for the discerning traveller. The flatscreen tv offers so many channels, you are spoilt for choice. Breakfast : Superb and elaborate spread. I love the table by the large windows overlooking the iconic Bundaran HI.Staff : Very friendly and attentive, which reflects positively of Indonesia's famed hospitality.Security : You are definitely as safe as the President of Indonesia with the hotel's security team, with strategic check-points to prevent entry of the undesired.Location : Pullman Jakarta Thamrin is one of the four main hotels around the Bundaran HI roundabout, its other three neigbours are Grand Hyatt, Kempinski Hotel Indonesia and Mandarin Oriental. You just need to use the overhead pedestrian bridge to get across to the posh and sexy Plaza Indonesia and from there, you cross another road to get to Grand Indonesia Shopping Town which is a super mall requiring at least one full day to explore.Value for money : A definite yes. I closed my eyes when I looked at the room rates of the three other hotels in the vicinity of Bundaran HI. But Pullman is the savior, it does not burn a hole in my pocket!Will I return again : YES!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in the heart of Jakarta downtown, while the hotel does not impress from outside, inside is i pressive. A catchy entrance, very spacy rooms and i found the pool and the gym very well attended.Good choice of restaurants and for the business center everything works seamless. Arrange the temerature target in the meeting room upfront, otherwise you will freeze. Service level of the hotel staff is very good as well and should you need to go around, there is always options.Very good overall option for Jakarta accomodation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with family. The moment you stepped into the hotel lobby, you can feel the luxury touch. The relaxing aroma scent, the fine furnishing at the lobby and check in area and the warm smiles from the bell boys and the counter staff were warmed and comfortable. Room is tight but adequate with all the supplies and very clean and in tip top maintenance condition (heard that the hotel just refurbished). The gym is adequate, a nice pool with relaxing sun deck. Bathroom with jazcuzzi, steam bath and sauna. I enjoyed the rain shower in the gym bathroom. The spa has lots of spa services at reasonable price.Breakfast spread offers wide selection.Location is very strategic and convenient for shopping and dinning without getting into the traffic. Cross over the pedestrian bridge you will be at one of the Jakarta Luxury Plaza Indonesia with International brands chains. You can find many Chinese restaurant and a up scale food court Urban Kitchen at affordable price offering Asian foo. A short walk further in opposite to Plaza Indonesia will be another big shopping Mall - Siebu next to Hotel Indonesia. There are plentiful restaurants to choose from as well as shopping that can keep you busy for days. If you are frustrated with the traffic Jam, try staying at this hotel over the weekend. Its no car day on Sunday from morning to noon. Many activities such as group cycling, street performances, street market etc. and best walking on the road to the fountain diagonally opposite the hotel. It is a difference experience of Jakarta when you stay here. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Best hotel in a very strategic location. close to many malls and business centers in Jakarta. Spacious room and comfortable interior. cleanliness of the room and bathroom are very satisfactory. Service of the hotel staff were very warm and helpful and serves all needs during my stay. Overall I am very happy and satisfied have stayed in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia, and I will select and recommend the Pullman Jakarta Indonesia to my colleague.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This my first time staying at the hotel after renovation. Overall, the room is a lot better compare to before the renovation. The tv channel were setup carefully, thus all channels were crystal clear.The breakfast also better, with very wide range of selection and the taste was surprisingly good for the price that they charged. The location is just at the center of Jakarta, just next to Bundaran HI.The only drawback during my stayed was it's shower curtain that smell very bad and the night table was not thoroughly cleaned . I think the hotel doesn't regularly check the cleanliness of the room as the problem was not difficult to spot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Exceptionnel cooker with a fantastic buffet dinner and breakfastGood locationBedroom really averageShower bad brokenImpossible to remove water from bathBathroom very smallQuite noisy from outsideFor me it s a 4 stars not 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I liked the hotel overall. Good a la carte food, great swimming pool and fitness center, a comfy bed and good WiFi. However, I was disappointed that with a Silver membership status, I found the Advantage plus desk to me unmanned when checking in. In fact, there was nobody there 2 out of the 3 trips I went by the front desk and I had to wait for standard service. This wouldn't be a big deal for me normally, but when combined with the fact that I also had to stand while checking in and was not offered a standard complimentary welcome drink, I was quite disappointed. The bathroom showed some signs of wear below the sink (paint chips) but I loved the fact that there was a speaker in there for the television.Ultimately, if you're there for business or get a good deal on the room, go for it. Next time I'm looking for a nice hotel for a weekend getaway I'll go to Central Park Pullman instead though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is nice. Near Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia.All staffs are very friendly.Room and bathroom are big ok. We stayed at the brand new renovated room.Air conditioner is too cold, although we made 30°. Freeze all night.. brrrrrr
-------------------------------------------------------------------

arriving at the lobby I felt that the hotel just been recently renovated, the price was expensive but it was alright compared to similar hotel nearby. Location is very convinience and located in the central district, very easy to go around. The room however, felt like its not yet included in the renovation. The bathroom felt like its from the old age. Staffs were friendly and check in was fast. nothing else to shout about.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was very strategic and well known location where Pullman located. Bundaran HI, The lobby was very nice after they renovated it. My fiance and i got the room facing to the Thamrin Street, you can see the crowd at night and in the morning while there is a car free day. The room was clean and very comfort bed with big pillows. The staffs very polite and professional in the way of asking either explain something. definitely will come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good service provided by hotel. Check in was fast and the hotel is centrally located. The view from the hotel was great and we could see the event on Sunday where the roads were closed. The breakfast spread was fantastic. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For first timer to Jakarta, Indonesia, it will be the decision of where to stay after hearing the acute traffic jam in Jakarta. Jakarta is a metropolis with more than 10 million people living within the city boundary. So with that in mind we tried out the Pullman Jakarta. It was a good decision as it is centrally located and could be the CHEAPEST hotel compared to the other well known 5 star hotels within the same vicinity - The Grand Hyatt, The Kempiski and The Mandarin. All the best shopping is just across the road and you need to take the pedestrian bridge to cross over - The Grand Plaza is typically a highly branded shopping mall with good food outlet, just across the Grand Plaza is even bigger shopping mall - The Plaza Indonesia with a mix of medium and luxury items and fantastic food paradise.If you still do not want to shop in these two branded shopping malls, then walk straight up passing through Seibu shopping mall and Ascot Hotel to Thamrin City which gives you a good bargain for mainly clothing with Indonesian style. Still, if you do not want to shop at Thamrin City eventhough it is cheap, walk further up to Tanah Abang market - things are comparable to Thamrin City and even cheaper. If you are looking at good Indonesian craft you could walk to Sarinah shopping mall.All these are within walking distance from Pullman Jakarta or you may fetch a taxi just outside the hotel by the roadside or call the famous bluebird taxi from the reception or the counter at the main entrance of Pullman [the bluebird taxi is known for its honesty and will use the meter]. If money is of no concern, take the Silverbird taxi as you will be travelling with style, just like the rich and famous - price could be slightly more than double.So here is a hotel with reasonable price, centrally located in one of the biggest and busiest shopping district. On Sunday between 6.00 am to 12.00 noon the road in front of the hotel and the roundabout call Bundaran H.I to the Grand Plaza and Plaza Indonesia is closed to vehicular traffic. Get up in the morning and join the local population to take a stroll, jogging or bicycle ride and there are street market as well.Pullman Jakarta should be a good choice with friendly hotel staff all round. The only downside is the room that we occupied did not a have a strong hot water pressure. It is still OK but with a good water pressure for the shower it would be even greater after a long day's walk. Take the room facing the Bundaran H.I, Grand Plaza and Plaza Indonesia as they are more lively.Saharudin & MariamKuala Lumpur, MalaysiaStaying Jan/Feb. 2014Reporting 04/02/2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed one night at this hotel and it was great night and deserve every penny. it is huge hotel with great bar and huge lobby too but the room was my only concern it was too small. I will absolutely come back again if I have the chance and I would recommend it for anyone going to Jakarta. it is around 45 minutes from airport and in front of Plaza mall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed two nights. During the first night, all lights of the room were turn on at once at 4.30 in the morning. This was a very efficient way to wake me up in the middle of the night. I had to get up to turn them off. I couldn't go back to sleep before 6.30. Same treatment again at 7am. I remind me boarding school where we waked up the same way. I thought this period was over for decades!We also had a few pages we worked on while staying at this hotel to be printed. There where no ink in the printer available for clients. We spend half an hour with the concierge to try to print those pages without success.We ended in the business center of the hotel across the road to get our document printed for our afternoon appointment...I'm probably mistaking in expecting such a service in a Pullman Hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice and neat hotel. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Room is a bit small though. Food is good dan a lot of variety to choose from. Just a walk away from my favorite malls.A little annoying sound from next room's plumbing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the renovation on the ground floor was completed and the hotel is no longer Japanese oriented. Room is small but ok for single business travellers. Wifi quality has been well upgraded to satisfactory speed & stability. Swimming pool & gym were superb. Buffet breakfast at Olive Tree has wide range of food options that one cannot get bored even visiting everyday. Hotel staff are generally friendly & helpful.APPRECIATIONS- Staff at Olive Tree always bright up my day with their quality service & friendly smile- Newly renovated ground floor is upbeat, spacious & warm- Gym facilities are new & good quality- Convenient location with easy access to 2 shopping malls across the street- Wide option of newly opened restaurants on ground floorDISAPPOINTMENTS- Jacuzzi & steam room closed too early at 10pm- Queuing for front-desk look disorganized- Card key system in the escalator is not convenient. Should consider contact-less card key instead- Superior rooms are a bit small
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here last July while the hotel was under renovation, it was still a pleasant stay. Now it is finished it was an even better experience. The staff are great, the hotel reception is really pleasant. Feels like home each time I return. Definately recommend this hotel, bar is cosy, restaurant breakfast has everything that you could want and the spa treatments were delightful. Looking forward to returning. Just one thing, this time I was given a room with an adjoining door to the next room and you can hear all the noise even though the other guests were talking at a normal level, so sleep was somewhat disturbed at times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I hv stayed at this hotel 4 times. I love this hotel because of its very good location, very close to big malls and other places.5 counters for check in...wow! Now place for breakfast moved to first level close to lobby. It's really bigger and more comfortable place for dining. Pls see attached pics.Bakery: tasty pastries and bread. No margarine. 100% butter. We know that margarine is bad fat. Butter is good fat.Lobby is very spacious, free wifi, with a room for free internet/PC.Free wifi in bedroom.Better choose a room with a view of bunderan HI.I like its bathroom. I can see tv while relaxing in bathtube.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The flight from Yogyakarta was delayed almost one hour, and I took a taxi at around 9.00 p.m. The taxi ran smoothly at first, but after a while, began to run and stop due to heavy traffic jam. The driver passed a byway and arrive at Pullman Indonesia Central Park around 11.00 p.m.It was Friday evening and it rained so heavy, then it took almost two hours. but it was not the hotel I reserved. when I took a taxi at the airport, I told a driver to go to Pullman Jakarta, previous Nikko Jakarta, and decided a taxi fair, but he misunderstood this Central Park was the only Pullman. There were two pairs who also came here by mistake. If there is a free shuttle bus between two hotels, it's good. But there's no shuttle bus, then I took another taxi and arrived at my hotel just before 12.00 p.m. (midnight). It cost extra. The reception is at first floor, then I had to take an elevator from second floor. (It's very inconvenient. Is it difficult toimprove?) I didn't take dinner yet, then I asked room service, but after 12.oo p.m., dishes on menu are not available, then I ordered Spaghetti Napolitana (spaghetti tomato sauce). It seems simple, but I had to kept waiting for 20 minutes, then I called, and after 30 minutes I followed angrily. After a while, Napolitana came and I took beer. After arriving at the airport, I had a hard time of it, but at last, I recovered my presence of mind. The hotel is located just at the center of Jakarta, where there are big shopping malls and otherhotels. And MONAS-Monument Nacional is also close. On the next day, I walked to Monas and the Leap bridge at Kota. It began raining, I came back to the hotel by taxi. At that time, heavy traffic jam also occurred near Kota station. In the evening, I took dinner at the Japaneserestaurant in Grand Indonesia mall, near the hotel. On the third day, it was Sunday. when I went outside, the main street named as Thamrin was a pedestrian paradise (a street where vehicles are shut out temporarily). I enjoyed walking on the center of main street for two hours. I'm supposed to take 14.00 flight to Brunei and I asked what time shall I leave the hotel, because I feared traffic jam, but they answered there's no traffic jam in Sunday morning. Then I left at 11.30 and got to the airport before 12.00. "All is good that ends well"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was pleased with my stay. The room was a little small, but it was fine as I was on my own. The gym and pool were of high quality. Breakfast and dinner buffet were a little disappointing for the money. Overall this was good, but not exceptional. Staff were always very friendly and keen to help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was excellent, the staff was has friendly at 2 am as during the day, the food was very good, great buffet breakfast with lots of choice for all taste. Very close to CBD and shopping area ccc    
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Not bad condition of hotel, location is perfect to reach most famous area in Jakarta. but breakfast is not fresh this time usually fresh. Staff does not know what guess want: ex: non smoking or smoking room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room is OK... Look modern,, but not a 5 star room should be I think,,, the size of the room is relatively small compared to other 5 star hotel... The fitness centre is the BEST thing about this hotel... The equipment there is really modern ... And the ambience is good.... Worthed to try if u like go to gym... What I don't like about staying in this hotel, is that I experienced an annoying sound from the bar or discotheque just across this hotel.. Around 2 a.m. The sound is still clearly heard from my room which facing the plaza Indonesia, which was really disturbing... I think the hotel should provide noise-free protection in each room, to ensure the comfort of the room...All in all, besides the noise, the hotel is quite good...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was at a great location for shopping. The staffs were friendly, the room was huge and clean. The housekeeping did a good job! The room service staff also did a good job and the foods were amazing. The spa staffs were also friendly. The bellboy helped us every time we came back with bags. However, there were stuffs that I was a bit disappointed. Before our stayed, we called the hotel twice to enquire about our booking, but then the staffs on the phone didn't sound friendly and they way they talked as if they are lazy to work. Then during the first day of our arrival, we went to the reception, but then we need to waited for our turn and that time, they were lots of guests. Once our turned, the receptionist asked us what do we want and we stated that we want to check in, and she said when? It really shows that we were tourists and of course we wanted to check in that day,that time. What type of question did she asked? After it has been settled, our room was still not in ready. So I asked for the wifi passcode, but then she were piss because she were entertaining another guest however she did answered but in a badly manner as if it was a huge problem just to give me the wifi password. The way she gave was a rude. During our last day, for breakfast, we were asked to waited for them to give a table, and there were huge crowd waiting for their turn. It was not a great experience for our last day. But overall we were satisfied with our stay just a thing or two that make us disappointed
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting with our group and stay for 2 nights, this hotel have strategic location in the city center , near Bunderan HI and Plaza Indonesia. The room was so clean and very comfort bed. The food is excellent and very taste. the meeting room also very nice with delicious coffee break.I really recommend this hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good service, Cozy room, friendly Staff. Room services are good. Clean room. However, the house keeping tend to forget to reload some tea, it doesn't reflect any bad impression to me. Will be coming here again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great view from the room as it is facing Grand Hyatt hotel and we could see the famous Bundaran HI and Patung Selamat Datang. Plaza Indonesia, EX and Grand Indonesia is within walking distance. It is a car free day on Sunday, so we could join many others to do jogging to Monas.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Purposely booked this hotel for the location. When you are in jakarta, you really cant stand the traffic jams so we booked this hotel for our convenience. Plaza indo n grand indo are just opposite of this hotel. Thamrin city also very near we could just use bajaj to get there. Hotel room was ok but its too small if youre traveling w kids i think. The hotel ambience was really nice, staff are all friendly till we get tired of their greetings hehe. Spa was superb and really cheap for 5star standard.Will def come back! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very well located hotel in the centre of Jakarta close a couple of very popular malls. Absolutely no issue whatsoever and definately good value for money compared to similar properties in the same area. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

stayed at this new renovated pullman 3 to 5 jan, was surprised with the location. you can get to Plaza Indonesia or Grand Indonesia in 5 mins, walking distance. checking in at 1 pm, the reception lady, she’s a very helpful and make the check in fast and effective.pity that the elevator on the first floor isn’t working or under renov. so i need to walk to the second floor to get into the elevator, lucky me that i am a light traveler, only a backpack. but imagine the elder or a heavy traveler with bunch of luggage…phew no fun :Proom was so so, asked the reception to get me a floor with a view of jalan thamrin, view was OK and room was not as fancy as i expected from 5 star hotel. this pullman feels more like novotel, can’t really sense the 5 star ambience. at the second day, i asked the reception if i could get another room for a friend. i asked for the same floor non smoking and twin bed. heres the problem, when am about to make the payment, the reception told me that my card isn’t supported with their payment method. i told him to hold my room, because i need to attend a mass in a church near sarinah. went back to the reception at around 7ish pm, met the reception lady and another lady, not sure if she’s a reception officer too, named Florence. She asked about the deposit or so using cc or cash, i told her that i only have a master debit card and nothing else. I kinda feel that the reception officer at the evening kinda make me bit struggle with lil issue about deposit, she can just ask me to pay the room and the deposit using the same card without making me look confuse on how am gonna pay. so much easier dealing with the morning officer than at the evening. also, the lady kinda have a lil chit chat with other employee in another reception desk and laughing a bit…while me here standing there in front of her waiting and looking at here laughing and chatting, seriously. the other lady, ms florence, finally remind her not to have convo and get her business done first. payment done, room checked, i gotta hurry because i have an appointment in Plaza Indo. They gave me an envelope with a proof of payment and, i tot, the key card is in it as well. But hey, when i was in Plaza Indonesia, i check in my envelope and theres no key card. what a nice thing.back from the Plaza Indo and bring my friend to stay with me in pullman, the employes r all friendly, feeling like a royal here. went to the reception counter to get the key.I love the location of this Pullman. Cant comment much about the food, i ordered only breakfast on saturday, and weird because i got same but different american breakfast at sunday. check out was very quick :) taxi is just step away from the lobby. thank you pullman! stayed at 825, friends at 820, jan 3-5
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanna see old n new celebration in thamrin. Quick n good prepared check-in. Best view room. I got everything i noted in my reservation. But i forgot to use my free breakfast coupon from advantage plus. So sad. I suggest the front office will remind it. Overall very good n comfy for me n my family. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at the Pullman for one night, and it was our first time in Jakarta. The staff was extremely helpful helping us organize sightseeing in Jakarta as well as an extra bed. We stayed in a deluxe room, and it was large enough for the 3 of us. Breakfast was great with standard continental as well as Indonesian, Japanese, Indian etc. options
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Checked in to find my room was not ready. When a suitable room was made available, some thirty minutes later, it was a smoking room. This was totally unacceptable and although I moved to a non smoking room the very next day, my chest had already succumbed to the irritants in the air and I felt ill for the remainder of my stay. The hotel doesn't have that personal feel that I would have liked. Much of the interior was a little dated and renovations were ongoing. The breakfast area is especially dark and it felt like I was walking through a forest at night. What is needed is some natural light. The only positive to the stay is it's central location.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good location, clean room. I enjoying stay in this hotel because is near to the shopping mall. Many restaurants and prices are affordable. Hotell staffs are friendly and helpfull. Will be back someday  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our experience in this hotel was great. We really love the room, it was spacious...consist of living room, wardrobe closet, and huge bathroom. Location of the hotel was also terrific, close to amenities and walking distance to plaza indonesia and grand indonesia mall. The breakfast buffet was also extensive and tasted good.We will definitely will stay in this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- All staff are friendly & accommodative. - The room and overall hotel's ambience are design and structured in a pleasant way. - The facilities provided are adequate and well organised.- Overall I'm happy with my stay at Pullman Thamrin, Jakarta. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed at a number of Pullman properties and have always enjoyed myself to the max - until I stepped into this NIGHTMARE in Jakarta.Party of 4, we arrived at the hotel at almost 1am of 26 December after a 18 hour trip from Italy that started on Christmas Eve.We had two superior rooms booked and the IDIOT at the checkin counter put us on the 3rd floor - do you think he mentioned renovations are going on at first and second floor??? NO. Do you think he mentioned these rooms are caged between a metal structure and a cement terrace? NO.Do you think he mentioned hammering and banging starts at 9am to end at 5pm?At 1am, wrecked by the trip and not being able to see anything out of the dirty windows I just unpacked showered and went to sleep.This isn't bad service. This is a FRAUD.On to part 2 of the nightmare: concierge. I asked for a tour and one of the women said "may I suggest the Old Batavia tour" I read the program and said ok. $200 later we found ourselves 20 minutes later than agreed on a hot van with a broken seat, a guide who was either drunk or high who kept singing and whose English was unintelligible and who dragged us through a smelly market of Chinatown repeating 200 times some fruit names, taking us to some plastic temple full of smelly dead birds then on to some muppet museum where he left us with some old man who later dragged us into a building that looked like it had been bombed during some war and occupied by squatters where he tried to sell us some muppets who he claimed to be handmade by his 90 year old father.As if this was not enough we were taken under the scorching sun to see a port with some wrecked old ships without even the trace of a bottle of water within miles. Later we were taken through some dark hot alleys with the promise of a visit of the local fish market. We found ourself in a cubicle covered with chicken urine and feces and birds flying everywhere. I was trying to be man about it but when I saw my sister running back out to the main road vomiting the 3 of us lost it too. We asked to return more than 2 hours earlier than programmed. I don't dare to think what could have been next.Back to the idiotic reception staff, on departure day we called for luggage pick up at 10:45am, by 10:55 (as shown by credit card receipt) I had completed checkout for both rooms and asked the young lady to have a taxi van being a party of 4 with 3 huge bags and 2 carryons. She picked up the phone and called the taxi company and then told me I'd have to wait 30 minutes because these vans require reservation, having no other option I said OK and she told me I'd have to pay directly to the driver. We went to smoke and then kill the time on the lobby sofa and chairs (notice we were kicked out of the wifi system because we checked out) and after 30 minutes went by and a number of vans came through to pick various guests up I asked at the taxi counter woman where was out transfer, after having to repeat 5 times I had already booked it with the reception lady she went to ask and when she and back she said "they told me you cancelled the taxi" I swear to god I was going to kill someone at this point.Why on earth would I even ask where my van is if I cancelled it??!!Went on into an irate discussion at lobby, must wait more, no wait there is hotel car, no wait van is coming..Go back outside, a van comes, is this ours I ask. No it's not yours. 2 minutes later yes it is yours.But you must pay here. 310.000 rupiahs compared to roughly 240.000 I had spent on my way to the hotel including highway toll and airport surcharge. But I just wanted to get away from this mental hospital that is Pullman Jakarta. And we were finally out of the hotel premises at 11:55!!!!! Luckily there was no traffic because our flight counter was closing at 1.20pm I am always a fair guest when writing reviews on TA so I want to recognize the positive things too:5 stars for breakfast and SPA services which have excellent quality and extremely affordable prices.4 stars for in room dining - very high quality delicious food from appetizers to desserts but delivery and service is a bit inconsistent with delayed dishes, some cold items etc, no bread etc.3 for room comfort - average of 5 for the bedding and 1 for the bathroom due to the shower that is a mountain climb where if you are taller than 177 you won't fit and the water keeps alternating between hot and cold.Nevertheless due to the fraudulent service of lobby employees I cannot give anything but overall 1 rating - trust me I would give it ZERO if I had the option!Will pass on my review to Pullman/Accord and Agoda and I will cancel my upcoming stay at Pullman in Brazil.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Although pullman thamrin is currently undergoing renovations it did not even interupt my stay. Friendly staff made it so welcoming and it somehow feels like home when you just entered. Food was great too! Great location! Highly recommended for those whose thinking of business or shopping as the mall is just a walking distance. And the sundays was even greater, as theres a parade going on where you can join all the fun. :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at the Pullman Indonesia for 2 nights (21-22 dec) And had a great experience. We were quite worried from some of the reviews about what to expect but below is a summary of good and bad.Good:Location excellent- we were not sure if we had made the right choice vs. Pullman Central Park but we definitely did. As others have mentioned, right next to two luxury malls. Rooms were clean and bed comfortable. Pool clean, large and very nice area to sunbathe around.Friendly staff and service very good.Breakfast had a great selection - more skewed towards Asian but had a lot of choice. Spa facilities lovely, even changing rooms for the gym have hottubs, sauna and steam room (free of charge).Gym is right by the pool, bright and staff helpful. Equipment very good and new. Lobby is huge and looks very modern with nice floors and extremely spacious. Check in was super quick, we didn't wait at all and were greeted very nicely.Bad:Although quite nice, rooms are slightly smaller than an average standard room would be. It is quite narrow between the bed and the wall opposite ( where the tv is).As others have mentioned, since renovations are being done, you need to climb a flight of stairs I reach elevators that will go to your floor. ( wasn't a problem for us).I had requested to see a doctor for something urgent, at first they said that they would send immeditaley, they then called back and said that a nurse will be coming, rather than a doctor and we would be charged. (we stayed at shangri la in Kuala Lumpur the next day and they were so helpful, even had a member of staff escort us to the hospital in the cab). All in all was a good experience and we particularly enjoyed the pool area, fitness centre and breakfast.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My stay was on the 6th-8th Dec. As my family and i reached the hotel, it took them more than an hour just to check all of us in (there're several rooms). The front office lady screwed up the bookings. It was tough for me because i had a 3 year old boy who was super active and he was being restless.After checking in, the first thing i noticed was how big the furnitures were in a very small room. We barely had room to move. The key card was strictly for the floor you're staying in. That's fine but when you put family members on different floors, it became a nuisance. We had to go down to level 2 to meet up and go back to our floors. The lift doesnt exactly go straight down to lobby, we had to go down the long staircase just to go out and back to the lift. This is very inconvenient when there's elderly and huge luggage involved.But room service was good. Food was excellent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1 night stay at apartment suite was exceed my expectation. I really had a good day with their hospitality. located in thamrin street was a great deal, just walking distance to plaza indonesia shopping mall, japan embassy, grand indonesia mall.New lobby at the 1st floor has been unveiled, and it had a beautiful layout and design. Lobby area was spacious. Connectivity lounge, le chocolate were just beside the reception are. Credit to reception staff and other staffs around lobby, they were very friendly. Did not has a problem with check-in, My room (1001) was great. First at all really appreciated to pullman team to respond my request before my arrival. Respond very fast and well answered.The room located in edge of the building was totally spacious, separated living room, dining table with its equipment and wine glasses as well, kitchen with all utensils there, storage room with ironing board, wardrobe space, 2 lcd tv with local and int tv channel, separated shower and toilet, bathup, espresso machine, tea and coffee maker, and other supporting amenities. All worked properly, nothing missing with this room.I impressed with the cleanliness and the quality of room (please note room number 1001), all were well maintained nearly perfect. Room decoration, design, and layout were so beautiful and put me a good touch.Ordered sandwich and fried banana from room service. Delivered just in time and all were delicious and had a good portion.Bought chopped almond chocolate at le chocolate, taste very nice but too expensive for just one bite snack. Strawberry and raspberry tart bought was also nice, really be pampered with that dessert. However cashier staff at that time need to improve her friendlinessNo more comment for breakfast. good selection of food and beverages, and freshly served. Internet speed met my expectation. unfortunately, i was informed that executive lounge has been under renovation. meanwhile, the elevator on the lobby still in renovation, so guest must reach 2nd floor by staircase to have a working elevator.for those who driving by vehicle, better to park your car in the building (forgot the name of the building) behind the hotel, they have direct access to the hotel area in 2nd floor.missing thing:- no welcome drink given on arrival.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On the strength of reviews on this site i chose to stay at the Pullman Thamrin. I am like any holiday traveller, i like to spend money.. be pampered.. enjoy the fruits of a hard years work. This experience made me feel like i was a victim not a valued customer especially not a guest of Pullman. The first occasion there were some minor discrepancies in service however my first time in Jakarta im chalking up to lost in translation.. Until this stay i realised that its not lost at all its just complete lack of customer service. Yes we get greeted warmly by the staff and thats about it. Day one, booked a non smoking room, given a smoking room. To get that changed we had to wait until the next morning and call 5 times and no return calls to update us. We actually had to go to the reception to sort the issue out. It was a surprise to them that we asked for some kind of refund or additional service to make up for lack of service. The next day lets go for breakfast... not included in the room cost as understood.. At the time of signing into the breakfast buffet we were told the costs of breakfast is additional. And we had to sign when we are finished. All good.. wait no we were told a further 5 times during breakfast, even when i was plating my breakfast. When i asked for the bill to be signed nobody came back so as we were leaving to go to buffet reception a man literally chased us to ask to sign.Ok lets bring Mum for a spa day at the hotel. Make a booking and everything... we get to the spa and they told my partner that only one person can go in as they just forgot the booking and only had one staff available. Being a special holiday this distressed my partner further (after the above) Ok lets talk to the Duty manager.. I requested the GM's email and got the manager email in stead that bounces back. The second time we asked for the email they said no. Then they said the manager will meet with us. Again another 3 calls before i had to personally visit the reception to get the information i asked for 3 days previous. Pretty appalling. If we had the opportunity to move hotels we would have and unfortunately we wont be back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for one night at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia in December 2013. First time to stay in a hotel in Jakarta and we were a bit surprised about the high security level - when we arrived to the hotel, we needed to go through an "airport" scanner and the same for the bags that we had with us. Inside, the lobby area was very nice and we were immediately greeted by a hostess who took us to the check in desk. Staff speak English well and we we allocated a room on the sixth floor. Wireless internet is free all over the hotel and in the rooms and it works flawlessly. There are a variety of restaurants and bars in the hotel which we unfortunately did not have time to try out. The room itself was newly renovated and everything was spotless, nice and soft beds and very sound proof. Bath was clean and nice. Variety of tv channels is huge and there should be something for most people. Overall very good value for money and definitely a place we would return to should we ever be back in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Parts of the hotel was under renovation, so I understand the chaos. But services? I booked not through a third party, but directly to their official website, and they gave me a room that i specifically asked NOT for. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

great location and nice food. except room and toilet are small and look crampthe swimming pool is very nice and great hotel for relaxation and familyhotel provide good taxi service to the airport. Should go for the taxi from the airport instead of getting the taxi on the street as it cheaper as it charge a fixed rate. Better for that due to the heavy traffic jam  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here for 4 days for business. Even though I stayed in the old wing of this hotel, it never once look old. I even thought that the hotel was new! Very courteous staff from the security personnel to the bellboy, to the receptionist and staff all over. Kudos to the management on this!Gym facilities was modern and very well maintained. Trainer in the gym was helpful and friendly!Breakfast was sumptuous and well variety!Room was spacious and clean and you are able to watch TV right from your bathtub =)The only minus pt was the card access to the lift, seems like all guest have to try inserting a few times before the card was finally read by the lift.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Check-in was efficient. Staff are approachable and helpful. Location is great there are restaurants at Plaza Indonesia which located next to the hotel. There is a currency exchange shop at the basement of Plaza Indonesia, rate is much more competitive. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Beautiful interior, friendly staff and very good location in Jakarta city centre. Branded retail mall is just across the road, easily linked by a pedestrian bridge, making it very convenient. Although the room is pretty small for superior, the modern design however, especially the transparent glass bathroom is definitely a good trick to overcome this. Im not sure if they can fit in extra bed if there are 3 pax. Since I stayed solo, it was just perfect. My room didn't face jalan thamrin, thus has no issue of noise from public, but a total privacy indeed. Highly recommended!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first time staying here and it's somewhat different from the hotels I have stayed before.I arrived earlier than the standard check-in time (2pm) and was told to wait for 30min while they prepared my room. In the meantime, I was treated to a complimentary drink at the lounge for the wait. I did end up waiting longer as I had initially thought they would notify me once the room is ready (they said they would). When no one came, I proceeded to the counter and found that the room key was waiting for me to pick up (not sure if it is a miscommunication or they forgot about it).I had to pay Rp5million as security deposit which totally shocked me as I thought that was the price of my 3D2N stay (from my experience, the hotel would normally secure a deposit that amounts to the price of room for the stay duration). Upon check-out, I was charged less than 50% of that. I do not know if this is the standard practice to secure a higher deposit amount than the actual cost.The hotel is going for a modern design and I find this has sort of compromised in maximizing space.The room is smaller than what I expected for the price. It is cosy though - a double bed, small sofa, TV, mini-bar and a safe among others. The bathroom is also small. I found myself standing in a corner to open/close the door fully without it knocking into my feet which is surprising as I am petite in size.As part of the hotel is closed for renovations, guests are expected to climb a flight of stairs in order to access the elevators to our room floors and also the coffee house. Elevators are available on the ground floor to the first floor but it's a long walk - not really friendly for the elderly and those with children in strollers.Security to the rooms is good. Guests need to activate their room key in the elevator or else they would not be able to access their room floor. Make sure you do not place your room key card next to your phone. This will "deactivate" the card and you will need to get it "activated" again at the reception. Breakfast buffet is good although I feel the pairing of food could be improved. For example, miso soup is placed on the same island as the eggs counter instead of together with the sushi.Location of the hotel is excellent - within walking distance to several shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia etc). A good pair of walking shoes are recommended.Taxi from airport to hotel = Rp250,000 (toll charges inclusive).Will I go stay here again?Yes because my experience isn't bad.No because there are several other hotels nearby that I would like to experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

nice, elegant. clean and very satisfied hotel. this hotel is very near with shopping centre at the very central location very nice pool with hot and cool pool for sauna. let go here soon and enjoy the facility
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Please be more careful serving wine. Unfortunately the wine temperature always was not correct - too warm. The second issue I need to notice is on time release of the deposit on the credit card. Your staff confirmed during my check out that deposit will be released immediately. Unfortunately it was not true. I have to call my bank to do it. I have the same experience for my previous stay. This is not an issue with the most of the hotels I stay. I like your new renovated rooms. The design and the quality of finishing is very good.See you soon. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed for 3 nights for work purpose and I love it. The hotel is located within walking distance to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia which is convenient when I needed to buy dinner or went shopping. The breakfast was good and the most important things, the staff are so friendly and helpful. Definitely will come again next time.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed four nights, and from the first moment I was welcomed until the moment I was helped in the taxi to the airport I only met smiling employees. A real charm.The hotel reception just moved to the groundfloor lobby again and that made checkin and checkout very fluent. The room was not huge but modern and spatious with a good desk, chair and cabled internet (and Wifi for an unlimited number of devices). Restaurant and breakfast are nice and not too expensive, but don't forget there's more restaurants at walking distance.The trip from and to the airport is a traffic nightmare, it might be worth to request for a pick-up at the airport, I payed more to a regular metered taxi than the price the hotel charged me for bringing me back to the airport.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is close to the shopping mall, Plaza Grand Indonesia. There is a bridge connecting the hotel to the shopping mall. Surrounding the hotel are other 5 star hotels such as Grand Hyatt, Kempinski and Mandarin Oriental. To get to the hotel from the airport is a nightmare as many would know due to the massive traffic jams Jakarta is known as. It would very much depend on the timing of your flight. Check in was a breeze and hospitalility is great at the hotel, staff are friendly and helpful. The room is excellent, modern and new. The hotel is situated on a busy street, hence if your room is facing Plaza Indonesia, you can hear the traffic. Then again it wasn't that bad.The gym is excellent as well as it is well equipped with new and different types of equipments. The gym could be difficult to find depending on which lift you get out from. They should have more signage for this. Breakfast is reasonable with selections of Western, Japanese, Chinese and typical Indonesian. At the back of the hotel is the upscale Menteng area which has a number of good restaurants to try.Overall, it was a good experience at the hotel and would definitely come back to try out the spa treatments and shopping.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel is nice and modern, a bit quirky interior but not exceptional. The standard room was nice with a good bed, small couch and worktable but a bit smallish if you are 1.9m or above. The restaurant was nice (went for breakfast only) and the staff very attentive and helpful. Unfortunately the room was somewhat noisy. Overlooking Jalan Thamrin, a major thoroughfare, the double glass windows don't hold-out the traffic noise. This is however 'white noise' and not terribly troubling but the doors seem to have no sound-insulation properties what-so-ever. Through the adjoining door I could hear next door's tv clearly even though I believe it was not played particularly hard. Walking along the hall hearing others shower is even less amusing if you realise you just did it too.Apart from this the location along Thamrin/Dudirman does mean youo need some patience in traffic, the trip from the hotel to the toll-road, 3.5km, took 45minutes, from there to the airport 35 (which is actually quite exceptional).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Much has been said about this hotel. The location is excellent, walking distance to many of the malls and small restaurants in the Menteng neighborhood. The rooms are very comfortable and good value. Very surprised with the Accor brand after many years. However, breakfast needs to be improved and if you don't need it, grab it elsewhere as there are many cafes and restaurants very close by. Croissants are worth mentioning about but the juice is not great as I believe they use bottled juice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here with a friend who was attending a work conference. We had a non-smoking room facing the street. Room had two good beds and a small sitting area. Bathroom has a glass wall, but at least you were able to close it with a curtain. Staff was attentive and responded promptly to our requests (room service, getting an iron/ironing board) and concierge even booked a taxi to pick us up from a different location so we wouldn't have to struggle with the language. The pool area was great, as were steam/hot tub in the dressing rooms. The showers in the women's dressing rooms were both busted, however. Breakfast was wonderful, so many choices from all over the world. Staff incredibly polite, although we always had to ask threet times to get our coffee/tea orders right. Location is okay - short walk to the malls but the city really is not intended for pedestrians. You can take the bus to Kota/Batavia right in front of the hotel. Make sure if booking a taxi to the airport that they book a metered taxi - I did but they gave me an "exclusive" which cost triple, and then insisted it would take 15 minutes to call a regular taxi.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Preferred Deluxe room especially if your friend or family will visit you in the room and plus much better bathroom too.Superior is ok if you have no visitor and if you carry only 1 luggage. Bathroom (superior room) needs better exhaust or needs a manual fan.Breakfast is very good especially Indonesian food and dessert.Coffee is so so even for cappuchino.Great service all the way except concierge (?) service is very disappointing or perhaps not enough knowledge of surrounding areas?Walking distance to Plaza Indonesia (there is a bridge to get across to Plaza Indonesia) to get your grocery at Food Hall (basement level) or to Sarinah (about 3 blocks away).But do plan carefully to go the airport. You need at least 4 hours from the hotel to the airportBest to leave hotel if you can, window is from 10AM till 1pm, or plan 4 to 5 hours to the airportBest to catch Blue Bird taxi to go surrounding areas instead of driving.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel is so near shooping center plaza Indonesia and grand Indonesia. Easy to fine delicious food. The Sunday morning we can walk on the street. The hotel and room is so clean and the food is delicious too. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed as a couple at Pulllman for 4 days 3 nights and it was exactly what we needed for three reason - comfortable rooms, convenient location (Central Jakarta) and great level of service.Rooms & breakfast - Pullman offered everything you need for a comfortable stay. The Superior rooms were modern, clean and cozy (some guest mentioned that it's small but we had no issues with that). Even though we were facing a bustling road with continuous traffic, it was quiet. Slept well for all 3 nights. Only one of the nights we had an issue with the air conditioning which was promptly fixed. Breakfast was buffet style with ample choices. Location - The hotel was located right right opposite Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia, two of Asia's largest (and best) shopping malls in Thamrin. Cabs (Bluebird Taxis) are easily available and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel too. In fact we traveled quite abit around different areas of Jakarta such as Senayan, Mega Kuningan, Pasar Baru, SCBD, Cikini Menteng by taxi and face no issues getting to and fro to the hotel (just mention Pullman Hotel Thamrin when you are hailing a taxi back to the hotel)Service - For a chain hotel, we felt that it was very personalized. Check-in and check-out was fuss free. I remember when we first got to our room, there was a welcome call from their hospitality team to check whether the room was okay before i could put my bags done which was nice. Every staff was great from front desk, concierge (helped us with all our 'touristy' questions and travel arrangements) , the porters (we had a nice lad named Iqbal), the bartenders at Kemixtri, the team who fixed our air condition even so thank you. Will definitely be back again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I booked the non smoking room, but when we arrived we were given the smoking room. We were moved to the non smoking room the next day. But this is quite annoying as I ticked non smoking when I booked through Accor website and as a member of Le Club Accor. Internet sometimes did not work, safety deposit box did not work, kettle did not work. Room was too small. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I Stayed in Pullman CBD Jakarta for the first times, and I selected this hotel because the location is closed to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. The hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. Room's space is not so big but very clean and the furnished are modern. Overall I enjoyed the 3days 2nights in this hotel. I would consider to stay here again for my next trip and would recommend it to friends.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm very enjoying when i stayed at Pullman Thanrin, it was a great bed room and great services. the bedroom is really clean and the place for Spa is really comfort. thank you Pullman Hotel it's really nice experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Parking facility, receptionist, design of the room, amenities, internet facility and breakfast, these all are great and excellence. All these things made my holiday with family valuable and great. We really enjoyed to stay in this room.Just two things that we expected but nothing in this hotel, there are the swimming pool facility and children playground area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was my first visit to Jakarta, my local friend suggested me to stay here for its supreme location and the reasonable room rates. I was not disappointed at all, with the price I paid, a 4 star hotel felt like a 5 star to me! Right from the moment I checked in. Despite the long wait, it was done efficiently and courteously. I was very impressed with the complete re-vamp of this hotel which is run by the ACCOR group, meaning a refined french touch.The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. Lovely bathroom and facilities all in working order. Free and speedy WiFi. Great coffee machine and branded tea leaves in can provided in room. Room facing the famous Thamrin road roundabout is a sublime experience. Double glazed window meaning quiet and peaceful sleep.One really doesn't need to fork out that much more to stay across the road to Grand Hyatt or Kempinsky. Pullman provides a classy place to stay at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend it, especially if it's your first time in this vibrant and eclectic city.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying in Pullman Thamrin was a treat because of its great location but even more so because I stayed in the new annex building which is home to the Grand Deluxe Rooms. I have been to Jakarta for business quire frequently and stayed in various 4 and 5 star hotels but this room has blown me away. I absolutely loved everything about the room: the size, the comfort, the big TV, the stylish interior and not to forget the bathroom. I wished I could have stayed their longer and did not have to leave the room for meetings. I promised my better half to treat her to this gorgeous place next time we travel to Jakarta together.I had to checkout early so I was not able to experience the breakfast. Hence, I cannot yet comment on it but will certainly do next time I have a chance to stay at the Pullman.Service was very professional and efficient as one can expect and it was great value for money.The only downside I can report was the fact that when moving from the reception to the annex building one has to pass the Olive restaurant and I can imagine that the sound that my trolley made on the tiles could bother the dining guests. Especially when there are many people checking in and needing to move their luggage.Nevertheless, I will definitely come back and stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good feeling starts from the moment i stepped out of the cab. although it is under renovation in the ground level, you don't really notice it. the staffs are so friendly, we left both keys in the room and the staffs are so helpful and smiley. rooms are small but with all the things u may need and may not need, plenty..... food for breakfast and dinner.... all i can say.... fantastic and missing it already.... thumbs up for the service and location. will sure to make this a regular hotel for my trips to jakarta.last to mention but the most important!!! they have great massage and spa service. affordable and well trained.... i love it so much!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I spent 3 days and 2 nights in this hotel. It is a very convenient business hotel located at a prime location at the heart of Jakarta's central business district with a walking distance to a well known shopping malls at Bundaran HI area.Friendly greeting upon arrival. Reception staff was friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and efficient. There was a major renovation construction went on at the ground level of this hotel, that supposed to be the main lobby and reception area. Therefore the main lobby, reception, and restaurant were located at the 1st level, for temporary, I think. However, everything still convenient and didn't cause any disturbances.The bedroom was small with a modern minimalist interior, a very typical Japanese kind of hotel. However, the bed and pillow were very cozy.Swimming pool and gym facilities were good.Breakfast was good, with a various selection of foods, especially the Japanese food, since the majority of guests in this hotel were a Japanese business travelers.Overall, my fiancee and I were quite satisfied with this hotel in every aspect. Good job, keep up the good work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wondeful place to stay! Excellent service offered to me and the design of the bathroom is just astonishing. The location enables you to get a cab easily to any other place you would like to go to. I also enjoyed my morning meals. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed here for one night on our way to Borneo to see wild orangutans. The hotel arranged a pickup from the airport and this was excellent. The hotel was very pleasant but it can take a long time to go back to the airport and plenty of time should be allowed. The service was pleasant and helpful. Good access to the shops and restaurants - just across the road via a footbridge.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendly customer service and good location. The price is acceptable. What I like the most is the customer service and the cleanliness of the surrounding. I had a pleasant stay in Pullman Thamrin. I will visit again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel was previously known as the Nikko Hotel before it was acquired by Pullman and transformed into the chic hotel right in the heart of Jakarta. Together with Mandarin, Kempinski and Grand Hyatt, the hotel has the unparalleled view to Thamrin, Jakarta's centre. The modern and chic touch gave the hotel a new life and ability to compete with its modern surrounding.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for a night in the newly renovated grand deluxe room. Room is spacious and comfortable. Bathroom and its amenities were good. Breakfast could be better. Its not comparable to Pullman central Park both in taste and variety. Internet was good n fast. Location is central with easy access to plaza indonesia. Will be likely to come back here again once the renovation is done. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location of the hotel is very closed to Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. And also several embassies are very closed to this hotel. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Room's space is not so big but clean, good smelt and furnishings are very modern. Breakfast is also varies from Asian to European.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

we stayed at this hotel for 1 night to see 1000 bedug. so we choose the room that have Bundaran HI view.. this hotel near shopping center such as Plaza indonesia, EX and Grand Indonesia. in front of the hotel was bus stop. also near Monas, Istiqlal, Katedral, Gambir train station, and some museums
-------------------------------------------------------------------

very nice clean hotel with very nice swimming pool. reception was very helpful. I stayed 3 nights for leisure and 2 nights for business and when on business I had numerous meetings in the lobby and staff was very helpful. I did enjoyed my stay in this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is centrally located within walking distance from malls and financial areas. Upon arrival, you will be greeted with friendly staff, welcoming you to the hotel. The hotel is clean and room is spacious. For hosting of guest, the lounge is a great place with some pastries and drinks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am simply fond of these kinda bathrooms, so I was immensely pleased when I saw that my rooms (I had 2 different bookings) had this! I would have been absolutely happy except for one thing - the hotel was undergoing renovation/refurbishment at that time and my Grand Deluxe room smelled heavily of chemicals/paint. The windows couldn't be opened and I felt terrible and trapped. Come again some other time and you'd love it! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Is Good Five Star Hotel, I have enjoyed to stay at this hotel, good services, good room and clean, that was easy to look for great food and luxurious shopping... Can't Talk to much, because over all was Excellent... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel located about 5 mins walk to Grand Indonesia Shopping. Nice and big swimming pool, well equipped fitness center. Various choices of breakfast.Room on street side I expected to be very noisy but hotel room equipped with double glass windows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently stayed at Pullman Jakarta for 2 nights to attend a friend's wedding. The hotel is currently under-going renovation at the lobby but that does not really have an impact any travelers staying there. Check-in process was a breeze, I'm all set to proceed to my room in under 10 mins with no hiccups. The room was clean and definitely up to my expectation. The wifi internet signal in the room was also good with no disconnection issues. Pool area was great. Wasn't crowded and noisy with children running around. Pretty awesome gym as well. All equipment are new. For first-timers, to get to the pool area, you will need to walk through the spa and gym area. A special mention to one of the ladies at the front desk, RAHMI. Her service is simply fantastic! On the 1st night, I accidentally left my mobile phone in one of the BlueBird cabs on my way back to the hotel. Only realized it when I reached my room. Came down to the reception and Rahmi was there to assist me. After taking down all the necessary information, she got on a call immediately with the BlueBird cab hotline to log the case. She advised me to return to my room and wait for her updates. True enough, she called and update me the status of the search every 30 mins or so and finally at around 11 pm, she was happy to inform me that they have located my phone and will deliver it back at the hotel. (I must be one lucky soul!!!)The hotel is also conveniently located near to 2 huge malls: Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. These malls are just about 10 mins walk away from the hotel. Great, great hotel!!! I will definitely come back again on my next visit. Kudos to the Pullman team!!! =)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Do big hotels have to be impersonal? I know they can be and often tend to be and I can't really put my finger on this one but it did feel a bit strange to me. There are actually 3 hotel blocks here, two of which are directly the Pullman, and the third of which seems to be another brand. But the restaurants and bar are strange. Two are on the top floor of the other hotel, and two on the second floor of the main building (you walk through one to get to the other), and the bar is in the basement of the third building which is only accessed by walking through the two restaurants in the main building. All very strange and felt a bit disjointed somehow. Staff were great though, the room was excellent, albeit a bit small. Free Wifi (essential these days). Breakfast was excellent as well with a huge choice. The gym and pool were also very good (accessed via a corridor through the utility part of the hotel - strange again). The hotel is located opposite 2 malls with an access bridge over the road and so lots of eating options to choose from there as well. This is the embassy and diplomatic area of the city. Overall a good and nice hotel and better than the Sultan and Crowne Plaza where I have stayed before. There are 3 other hotels within a few hundred meters that are probably also worth checking out.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

let me preface this with the comment that I am a high standing Accor Favorite Guest member..probably with over 100 room nights (me plus my employees) in Accor properties globally this yeareven was I not...I would have expected. based on below...to have been spontaneously contacted by management before I checked out, but I was not;in brief;I rarely do room service..but weather wasn't great and my friend was feeling a bit off so..step 1; call room service...........the button on the phone doesn't work! further efforts to call reception fail; so..get up go to reception and explain and order from room service person who comes to reception....3 dishes and one bottle of winestep 2; knock on door...receive 2 items and winepoint out we are minus one item....big shock...confused looks....''ok sir I check sir''....I pointed out that he had taken the order and should be able to remember....apologies...I will bring now sir...ok..fine...it happens..wine bottle and 2 glasses on table....as he is leaving room.....my bran kicks in..''corkscrew?"its ok sir is twist top..u can just open..and out he goesnow FIRST...I am not sure that in a Pullman we expect the waiter to dump the bottle and go..but..not being a total snob I can wear it....maybe he he was docused on getting my missing itemsStep 3; try to open bottle///ITS NOT A SCREW TOP (doh!! I should have known this..Chilean red...some are..most good ones are not....my bad)Step 4..back to reception to demand a corkscrew ASAP pleaseStep 5; 13 minutes later....corkscrew and mssing 3rd item arrive together..assistant manager plus waiter came...and DARED TO PRESENT ME A BILL for the missing item to sign........in no hotel in the world can I imagine a service failure like this not being immediately 'comped' by the AMI basically told the AM to deal with the bill and then thanked them and closed the doorstep 6; start to eat 3rd item...which is stale and coldI have had better service in 2 star hotels than this...a top PullmanI wud hv expected the cumulative fiasco to have led at least to a note or call from the management before I left..but not a word
-------------------------------------------------------------------

actually i havent stay at this hotel, but i just wanna share in here my first time when i call to the hotel for check the room rate, the opertor transfer me to the reservation department, and i was shock when they said "HALLO" and suddenly turn off the phone....and i call again, the staff was talking with other person and pick up my phone...is it 4 stars ?i wish u can improve your staff attitude...thanks..will try stay ur hotel next time soon
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel never failed to impress me with the services. Though they are renovating their lobby now. Security seems to be tighter now. But it's location and food is pretty awesome. Their breakfast is pretty wide in variety and its one of the restaurant that serves Japanese breakfast
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoyed my stay in this hotel in Central Jakarta. Excellent service, good food and wellness centre. Overall this is a very good hotel although I wish the rooms were much bigger. Close to the two malls.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just had an excellent stay at the Pullman Jakarta Thamrin over the weekend. Beyond my expectation. A couple of points to note; 1) Hotel under renovation, was awakened by construction noises at 8am on Saturday after only arriving in Jakarta 2am earler. Special commendation to duty manager, Dedeh (hope I got the speeling right). Great attitude in handling the situation. 2) Breakfast queue in the morning can get quite heavy so be early.Thanks all at Pullman! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel room is very good furnished, with luxury equipment, and nice bathroom. The breakfast is good with a lot of menu variations. Location is near Grand Indonesia shopping centre, just accross the road. Unfortunately when i checked in, i came at 2 pm, and I have to wait for 2 hours for check in (at 4 pm).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in several Pullmans, and they are always extremely nice. I find it hard to believe that Sofitel is Accor's luxury brands. The Pullmans I have stayed in are nicer than any of the Sofitels I have stayed in. The location is fantastic. There are several malls across the street. There are several other hotels all in this area. The hotel is VERY nicely decorated. The gym is large and has nice equipment. The pool is fantastic. Breakfast is the best I have seen in a hotel for quite a while. The staff were good enough but could use a little fine tuning. Overall, a very nice stay in a very nice hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a 2nd business trip to Jakarta ( the last trip, stayed at The Millineum Jakarta in April). This time round, my management decided to book at Pullman Jakarta. I stayed in a Superior Room # 342. Although the room was a bit small but it was cozy. This trip we taken 3 rooms.It was wonderful to be back in Jakarta. Checked in on the 4th evening of October at 8pm after a good flight from Kuala Lumpur. We greeted
-------------------------------------------------------------------

near at business district easy access on other major malls and restaurants. the place have a nice ambient and receiving area. sexy restrooms and shower rooms. foods are served in variety you can enjoy eating and experienced a nice breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I liked this Hotel and I experienced another pleasant stay at one of the great Accor Hotels. The service was excellent and the location is great. Located cross the road from the shopping hub and fine dining restaurants, I highly recommend this Hotel and wish you all a pleasant stay.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is strategically located in the heart of Jakarta town. It can be seen clearly if you are at Bundaran HI. Its neighbouring buildings among others are Mandarin Oriental, Kempinski and Plaza Indonesia.The facilities such as swimming pool, gym and spa are excellent. The restaurant where we had our breakfast was good too in terms of its buffet spread and interior layout.Plaza Indonesia is just opposite of the hotel. Please note that this is a high end shopping mall where price of goods are really expensive. Head down to Thamrin City if you would like to get souvenirs, batiks or lovely kaftan tops at reasonable price.Premium Taxis are available anytime at the hotel lobby. We took a cab to Hard Rock Cafe and the driver took us for a stroll around Monas when we requested for a short drive around town. The 20 mins ride costs about Rp110k which we find very reasonable taking in the fact that we were in a luxury cab.This is a nice hotel complete with all the amenities you need for a business trip or if u are a solo traveller. I would not recommend it for travellers with family. The room is not spacious enough. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Courteous, friendly and true customer service. Home away from home. Lovely place and secured. Food was exceptionally good with lots of variety. Rooms were spacious and modern. Swimming and fitness facility was good. Taxi service and concierge was prompt. Many dining options near the hotel.    
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is at a very good location, near malls and restaurants even for VEGETARIANS.It is quite central and travelling to all parts of Jakarta is quite convenient.The staff is very co-operative and sensitive to guests needs.Did not try the food, but he menu does not seem to have much for Vegetarians.Vegetarians can try Komalas at Sarinah and Frontpage at Imam Bonjol Street which are at at 10 mins and 5 mins casual stroll walking distance from the Hotel.The only odd thing is the availability of ONLY SILVER BIRD taxis. Getting a BLUE BIRD taxi may take about 10-15 mins as they are called on request.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried to use my last free room from my advantage plus member, and i upgraded for IDR 425.000,- for a deluxe room, which i found so spacious.A couple days ago, before the stay, i emailed my request that the room should be facing the Thamrin road, and high floor, and non smoking, which they confirmed, they put into the system and will do the best to fulfill my request.So during the day, i was quite disappointed that the deluxe double bed facing the thamrin road is not availble, all the room was fully occupied, only the twin bed was available.That was not going to be acceptable since i was travelling with an infant, that would sleep between me and my wife.So i had no choice but to agree the room facing to the swimming pool and the parking building.The lady who sit in the accor designated table , told me to wait 15 minutes, for the room to get the final checking. She issued me 3 welcome drinks coupon, which i used in the alun-alun lounge for a drink looking at the roundabout of Hotel Indonesia.Then she came by to me, and hand me the key to my room, told me that the room was ready.First impression of the room, was spacious, which i would recommend for guest to upgrade to deluxe if possible, especially if you are not travelling solo.When you open the door, the first thing that was shown is the couch and TV, and working table, so you need to turn to see the bedroom and bathroom with a very nice bathub.Coffe pod was a touch, and together as well as the other drink facilities. The bellboy was kind enough to let me know, that if the compliment mineral waters was not enough, i could ask for much as i want because it was on the house. The view was kind a disappointing, because i was badly looking foward for a Thamrin view.But since there's anything i could do about it, so i just try to make my self feel good, by enjoying the superb bathub, a walk by the pool with my kids, and try to use the sauna facility which by the way, was comfortable enough and clean.I also tried the pizza from the olive tree resto by the side of the pool. The taste was average.During dinner, i walked out the hotel and took a crossing bridge located in front of the hotel to go to the shopping mall across the hotel ( plaza indonesia and EX ).The disappointment came again from the smell that was coming out from the toilet seats. Although i tried to flush several times.But the amenity that they served ( Roger and Gallet ) was specifically one touch, i loved them.The hotel renovation was kind a disturbing in my opinion, i could hear the grinder sound from the alun-alun lounge, and the Glue / chemical smell was so strong during my way to the swimming pool.Although from the 1st floor you hardly notice that there were some renovation work.Check out time was average, since 12 o clock, a lot of guest were checking out also at the same time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I obtained a room facing the busy main road. It was noisy and I had difficulties falling asleep. Better soundproofing is probably required for these rooms facing the main road.The main concern I had, was that the air conditioning was not functioning properly. I programmed it to the lowest temperature - 16.5 degrees Celsius. However, the room still felt stuffy. I reported this matter to the concierge, who promised to send their engineering team to investigate the problem. However, no one came and done anything to improve the situation.I was most impressed by the fit lounge (gym) in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. I loved it so much that I was there for 5 times in a 4 nights stay. It was furnished with such a complete range of equipment, and even had a group exercise room where I did yoga in.I will probably only be back, when they finish up their ongoing renovations. The smell is unbearable in certain parts of the hotel, especially near to the Chemistry Bar. I felt faint in the elevator situated at the Olive Restaurant. The air in the elevator was stale, and saturated with the smell of thinner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Really struggling what to say about this hotel. It is just, well, bland but OK.The rooms are OK, the prices are OK, the breakfast is OK. People are smiley and pleasant but isn't everyone in Indonesia?Clearly this is heavily biased towards the Japanese market which is fine as I love Japan and like the Japanese breakfast but the bar had a bit less atmosphere than the moon. I guess if you need bar you can cross the bridge and get a drink at the Hyatt listening to the soul destroying renditions of schmaltzy classics sung with as much passion as someone waiting for an annual medical.Wait , wait ....the gym is good. Very helpful and friendly staff with good equipment. Even as I write this I can feel myself........zzzzzzzzzzz
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This newly (and still ongoing) renovated hotel provides another option of respite from the frantic city of Jakarta. Check-in was fast, efficient and was greeted with friendly smiles and great service. Attentive service was once again met at breakfast, although the range of foods was predominantly Asian (the non-Asian breakfast was not the best, and tended to be overly sweet). The rooms were clean, and excellently equipped with wi-fi and all the expected amenities. Location wise - taxis were plentiful, it is a mere stone's throw to two high-end malls (with expensive price tags) which offer various eating options. The swimming pool and well-equipped gym are free to use too. On the downside is the traffic noise that seeps into the rooms facing the main road in spite of the windows being double glazed. If you are a light sleeper ask to move to another room. Also the dark carpets makes for a slightly dimmed overall ambience - minor point.Not as good as Gran Melia, but cheaper and a better location overall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My first time stayed at Pullman half of the price of Hyatt, everyone was very friendly ,front desk staff excellent,my room was good enough to sleep .The housekeeping did not vacuum the carpet but I had my flip flop on all the time. The breakfast was blah ...to many asian blah not enough european/american ,i am not rice or noodle person or miso soup ,the chef checked the breakfast area but never greet to the guest!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an excellent hotel and one feels it the moment one calls the hotel to make a reservation. The staff are very well trained and the service is just excellent. When i arrived at the airport, its staff escorted and helped me with my luggage. I also asked for a change of rooms after the first night because the room I was given was by the busy Thamrin Street in the CBD. I am a light sleeper. So, the moved me to a quiet room at the back where I had uninterrupted sleep. One day I accidentally left the no-maid service light on after I left for my meetings in the morning. But a hotel officer called me up in the evening to ask if I wanted the room tidied up. The staff were promptly dispatched and it was spick and span in 20 minutes. Though the rooms here are small, it has 5-star amenities and over delivers for what it lacks in size. The breakfast is also very good, with lots of choices from Indonesian to Japanese and Indian. This is my second stay at the Pullman and it is my first choice in Jakarta on business trips.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My 1st stay at the Pullman Hotel ever since it took over the old Nikko Hotel. I was glad it under went a renovation as it needed one badly. I could not find availability for the nights i required from the usual online booking sites, therefore I wrote directly to the Hotel and they managed to secure 2 nights for me at S$220 inclusively of taxes and breakfast. The rooms are decent but the bathroom should have been better renovated. They should have just taken out the bathtub and replace it with a good shower cubicle instead. The bath amenities are less to be desired so please bring you own if you are fussy. The internet connection was complimentary over wifi and was very decent in speed upload, a higher speed was offered for a fee. I did not have a problem with the free Wifi. The sound insulation wasnt that great as you could hear the traffic from the main road and when other guests were closing their doors. I was given a twin bed, which i thought were quite narrow and short. The gym and pool area was nicely renovated bigger enough for a proper workout with good equipments and free weights and yoga/aerobics room. The lockers had their jacuzzi, steam and sauna and was well maintained. The breakfast buffet was decent but nothing to shout about. I had 1 dinner at the restaurant which was alright. I dont think they have completed the entire renovation yet as the entrance still had hoardings up. The location for this hotel is great as there is an overhead bridge that connects you to Plaza Indonesia which is convenient for shopping and eating.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Have just stayed in the Pullmann for an education fair and will return in a couple of days. Great place and nixe standard rooms! Shopping malls are right across the road and the facilties and food at the hotel are excellent. Unfortunately the smell of paint through the renovation can be smelt throughout the hotel but lookibg forward to seeing it complete next year hopefully :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a very regular guest to Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. It's always a pleasure to come back not only for the ideal location, cleanliness of the rooms, and the quality of the facilities but also for the amazing attitude of the staff, always friendly, polite and efficient bringing the experience above many of other hotels of this category.The swimming pool is large and quiet, big fitness center and SPA. the food is good. My favorite outlet remains the cigar bar, recently refurbished when I like to come even when I'm not staying in the hotel.Definitely recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my fifth visit to the Pullman. I was there for buinsess and liked the hotel because of its central location. Despite the renovation at the ground level and resulting in a smaller lounge area, I was not affected by the noise of the renovation. The renovated room was very comfortable, more pillows and with better showers too. The Cable TV Channels had a wide selection from arts to news and movies. The black-out curtains were better than the previous visit. The major strong points with the hotel are the spacious Gym (24 hours access); good Wifi connections anywhere in the hotel and the generous Buffet breakfast. I had very early breakfast at 6.15 am on the last day before I checked out and the food was ready. The Gym workers were most helpful. Overall I enjoyed another Pullman experience with their ever smiling service staff. I will return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i read other reviews and knew to expect good service but was glad to have it confirmed when i stayed here and staff were very friendly and helpful.breakfast is amazing with a good range for a buffetgreat location with easy access to many of the malls and quick to get to other places in jakarta.room was spotless with great amenities - loved the separate shower.would stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i stayed for one night in this hotel. really great location on the center of jakarta city, i can see the fountain on Bundaran HI with her famous welcome statue. the room was quite good with lovely amenities and bathub. sportcenter was awesome, swimming pool is good one. very helpful staff, i order for french toast while i'm swimming in the morning but they give me not just toast but another dish who can make me stand until afternoon. but the bad thing was they still build new construction near swimming pool who ruin my relaxation on there. over all, i love this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the location of this hotel,And the food are goodStaff services are also goodFor the room, i didn't like the rear view, i think front view is better.Also the room still has the smoke smell, from the previous guest. (My room was 412, i asked a non smoking room when i checked in )Sleep quality is ok, i can sleep well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We needed to stay in area where we can easily meet people for lunch and dinner. Knowing Jakarta traffic we had to pick area that is easy for everyone concerned. Pullman is the perfect hotel for us and price is very reasonable compare to Hyatt and Kempenski. It is across from Plaza Indonesia so we met friends in the plaza, once for lunch and twice for dinner. We did not book standard room, but the next bigger one. When we arrived they told us they will upgrade us. the room has a separate seating area. We love our room, everything is new and very clean. Breakfast is delicious, lots a variety. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Next time we visit Indonesia we will stay in this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice staff, they spoke great English, knew the city and were very helpful. They recognised my Gold status and offered me all the privileges included. My room was nice and clean. Fast internet in the lobby, including free access to computers. Great hotel!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really love the room and the food. My family really enjoying stayed at the hotel. Especially My kids, they really love to swim at your pool because the pool is very nice and has a good view. Overall your hotel and the service are very good but when i came in i confused where is the lobby and i have to call someone to ask where is the lobby. Maybe you should put the direction in the front door to guide customer to going up to the lobby. See you in my next trip and holiday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has a great location... renovations really do not disturb ... good hotel over all. rooms as many people talk about.. yes,, they are a Little small.. but they are very nice and cleanStaff very friendly, you feel very safety, nice pool.. and breakfast buffet with good selection. I think this is a very good hotel for both, buisness and leasure.. I recommend it for everyone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel located in the center of business in jakarta. Compare to other hotel in this area, pullman has the best value.Across the road there are great shopping mallVery nice and helpful staff.The food was ok, not very different than other 5stars hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel must be one of the best hotel in central of Jakarta. It is because the location of the hotel is near to another shopping mall which is Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia.The room also comfort me in many ways. I will recommend this Hotel to whose visiting Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As my waif wanted to avoid the traffic during Friday night before Lebaran at Cikampek Toll road, we as family decided to stay at Pullman Thamrin Jakarta.The room was gorgeous, the swimming pool was excellent and the food was perfect.Overall is excellent.Thanks Pullman!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I stayed at Pullman Jakarta three nights before leaving Indonesia at the end of our holidays. At thd time of our stay (June 2013) the hotel was undergoing some renovation works. Thankfully this did not have any major negative impact on the quality of our stay. Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and efficient. A few minutes after we entered our room the reception called asking whether everything was fine and if we liked our accommodation. It was the chance for us to point out that our in room safe could not be locked. In a short time a lady from the staff came to our room. She tried to reset the safe lock. Since that did not work, she asked us to be patient and a few minutes later she was back with a colleague from the technical staff. The safe was fixed in less than ten minutes. A great thanks to both the lady and the guy from the technical staff.Positionwise this hotel is first rate. You are right in the middle of the business district. For both tourists and business travellers that means less time to spend in the traffic. Jalan Thamrin is right outside the hotel and you can reach on foot Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia and Thamrin City shopping malls, with plenty of shops, stores, restaurants and cinemas. Before selecting Pullman I read its reviews on Tripadvisor. Some pointed out that the shower water pressure was not very good. Though I have been to other hotels where shower water pressure was stronger than at Pullman Jakarta, I have to say that water pressure was good and I could have shower without any problem.We never had breakfast at the hotel (too many options across yhe street), so I cannot comment it.All in all we would definitely go back to Pullman Jakarta. Should that happen, we would try breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is a good option for business travel with a price tag a bit below that of nearby 5-star hotels. As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms ARE very small, but clean and comfortable. Breakfast is decent and service was fine. The pool was good for a late afternoon dip.Probably not ideal for a family holiday, but definitely an option for business travel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman is one of my favorite hotel and I've been spending many night at some Pullman. And the room in Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is definitely the smallest and the most disappointing room of all. The room is really small that you can hardly move anywhere, not to mention how small the bathroom is.Breakfast was a little bit disappointing, that I don't think they have much to offer.I will be happy to accept such room and breakfast, if I was staying at Ibis Styles or Novotel. But these were not kind of things that I accept to get when I was staying at Pullman.However, the cleanliness and service was great. Check-in and check-out were really quick. And the location is really really great.The room is absolutely overpriced. So, i will stay in this hotel next time, only if there is a promo that offer the same price as Novotel or Ibis, because I think the room is in the same class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

First time to stay in this hotel, and my first time to be in Jakarta, and my first time to visit Indonesia.I'd say I had many good firsts and this one was no exception. I stayed only for 2 nights and was really busy with business and entertaining customers that I had to skip breakfast to have more sleep. I still had a good sleep though thanks to the comfortable pillows and bed. The hotel is within the business district, thus it was the ideal location for me. I found the room to be a bit small but well-appointed nonetheless. I will definitely be back in Jakarta and will stay here once more to give a better review. And I always review the food in all my trips so hopefully I can enjoy breakfast at the hotel next time around.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I really enjoyed my stay here and would return again. The staff were all very helpful and the room was clean and modern (if a tad small).The sauna, jacuzzi and pool facilities are excellent - especially after a day in Jakarta. The staff were also great with allowing us to arrange a later check-out till 2pm with now extra charge. Would highly recommend!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time stayed in Pullman Thamrin with my partner (I am Indonesian and my partner is European), the concierge was really really friendly and helpful. The location also really good, malls everywhere and I can experience "car free day" in the busiest city in Indonesia, because Pullman Thamrin located exactly on the main street of Thamrin. The room is great and clean. Some of things make us upset are : we checked in and I gave 2 passport (mine and my partner passport). First the receptionist lady didn't look at me or either smile, she just talked to my partner, she took my partner passport and let my passport on her desk. She didn't say if the hotel only need 1 passport for check in. And I said to her "So you don't need my passport?" she didn't answer me and my partner getting uncomfortable with that. We booked 2 nights for double bed for 2 person, the receptionist question made my partner shock is "How many room do you need? 1 room or 2 rooms." I was also shock and I don't understand, how she can handle guest check in before she read the guest reservation details. I am working also in hotel business so I do understand how should be the receptionist treat all the guest, not only friendly and give a good service to foreigner guest and no friendly to domestic guest. At the end of our uncomfortable situation, I explain to receptionist lady what my partner want because she didn't understand what my partner said.We will stay again here if the receptionist attitude all trained well to all the guest. Big thanks for all concierge for your help...and friendly security.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I checked in this hotel during the weekend, which caused me to wait for more than 2 hours just to get a room, despite the reservation I made 1 month prior to my stay. No big deal on that one. The front desk staffs(Firza and Marshel) were helpful and very patient. When I finally got the room and was only 10 minutes in it, the manager on duty apparently made a mistake by going onto my room with just one ring of the bell(I understand the standard is supposed to be 3 rings of bell). She probably just going to check the room and were informed that my room was vacant. Quite uncomfortable for me, personally. The room itself even though quite small, but so comfortable and clean. The breakfast is nice either. Big buffet with many selections, and all of the food I tried was good. The staffs are all friendly and professional. The location of the hotel is strategic if you're on business trip. For shopping goers, the big malls just across the street could fulfill your desires. All in all, it was a pleasant stay for me. Would comeback again for sure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

this hotel is obviously for business.. with the location on center of the city, you can easily reach most of the place for your business trip.. and if you stayed for the weekend, you might ask for room that has thamrin view (HI roundabout) to see "car free day" on sunday morning..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

a little dissapointed,we arrive hotel around 6.30 pm & must wait for long time before my room ready even they give me a room for us to take a rest. as i know for last check out is 12. please change the office chair, the leather already crack really not suitable for 5star hotel....
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stylish, modern hotel with an incredible eye for detail. Staff is very professional and friendly. Rooms are comfortable, excellent mattresses and bedding, beautifully appointed bathroom, great showers, de luxe amenities and perfectly clean!Public areas are of an amazing design and also here everything is amazingly clean and well maintained.Location at the heart of the city - perfect to get to around in the business district, but also very easy and close to the main points of interest like museum, palace, national monument, mosque and cathedral. Three huge shopping malls just across the street.Recognition as repeat guest is what it should be. They really set an example for all other hotels: from name recognition to personal hand written welcome note, to little complimentary sweets and all personal preferences are remembered so a very smooth check in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing renovations do nothing to help draw guests to choose a hotel due to the noise and inconvenience, but instead of focusing on winning customers over through the other aspects like good service, they have exhibited poor service and bad manners.The guest relations/front desk lines are impossible to get through at times, even after left ringing for MINUTES.It is unimaginable that the only way to speak to someone is to have to the lobby yourself.Overall, front-line staff were not anywhere near eager to serve and impress.Can't really be bothered except to go throught the motion.Previous experiences during earlier stays over the past few years were better though.A real pity for the brand, especially after taking over from Nikko management.Definitely not promising of things to come.Location-wise, it definitely has the advantage.The downside is that for some reason, the hotel has chosen to renovate and upgrade while leaving all the rooms' old windows intact, meaning poor sound insulation from the busy traffic just in front of the hotel comes through every morning/afternoon/night.You have to be a real heavy sleeper to survive the rooms facing the traffic.I hope it improves, otherwise it's a real waste for a hotel in a good location and having spent good money to refurbish.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

stay for 2 nights & booked for 2 room at 619 ans 621, the overall experience is quite good with friendly staff equip with general hotel knowledge. Bed is quite okay, however i don't get the point of providing a really large pillow...thus the pillow quality is not up to the par for this hotel standard is not hard but its not padded either. Room design is nice, small but very neat and everything is in a good placement. Amenities is really unique and very adequate, all wrapped in a sachet style.Breakfast is great and provide you with a lot of choice, only the beef bacon and lamb sausages is not really tasty as it should (based on my opinion). Location wise is great, 3 minutes walk to Plaza Indonesia, taxi is easy, havent got a chance to try the pool. During my stay from on 22 June 2013, there is a parade (Jakarta's birthday), really loud noise from the street could that be heard until 12 pm..not the hotel's fault though, the next day is all good. Consider to stay here again if we can get a good deal
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We reserved this hotel and using direct payment via accor website since months ago. I also informed months ago that I will use the facility of room upgrade, and the reservation officer at that time confirmed this. We arrived at the hotel @ 3.30 PM, and went to the reservation counter for check in. As we know normal check in time is 2PM, but guess what? The officer says that the room is not ready because they have only limited deluxe room (which is entitled for my stay), and the guess in the deluxe room mostly utilize their late check out. I was very unhappy because I reserve the room since months ago, they should be able to arrange that the guess in my room can not do a late check out because the room will be utilized by the next guess (me)!However, there is no other room available so we have to wait. They offer us to wait at the lounge and having our welcome drink. 30 minutes passed I come back again to the counter and she said it still needs time approximately 1 hour. Gosh, terrible!! further worse that I ask how would I know when my room is ready? She said that she will come to inform me, or I can come back to ask again. What?? I don't think I have to come back all the time for asking my room. This is absolutely very unprofessional respond.Finally, after 1.5 hours waiting, I asked to the person in charge in the lounge, to ask the reservation counter whether my room is ready. At last, we can use or room at 5PM. The reservation counter consist of 3 ladies and 1 guy, and they speak to each pther with loud voice not showing a proper attitude of the front office employee. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Used to be the Nico Hotel. I stayed when it was, and first room I was shown was so small I upgraded to a suite. Now it's been refurbished as a Pullman. The rooms seem bigger and are 100% nicer. The bathrooms in the Nico were like cupboards. The bathrooms in the Pullman, while small have bathtubs and are quite nice. One wall is glass, so if you're into watching your mate shower- that's cool. We stayed here through my Accor membership and a credit card promotion discount. It is fairly pricey for the room size though if you pay full rates. Staff are very friendly, check-in was lovely. The room is well fitted out with pleasant touches like soft beds and good quality linen. Stacks of things in the bathroom too like shampoo, face lotion and shower gel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I Stayed there at 26th May 2013,I like the room design especially the bathtub.my only concern is only the Air Conditioner .I put key at the key tag for electricity all day long , but the room still warm all the night . Maybe the air conditioner just too old or not yet maintenance properly.I remind reception upon my departure . Hope they will fix that.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has lots of potential has a great location, very nice pool and gym. But, there is an extensive renovation going on, and the staff requires additional training to better anticipate guests needs. Left my room this morning to go for a meeting, returned in the afternoon and room was still not made. Had to track down a wait person to take my lunch order. I suspect when the renovation is complete it will be a beautiful hotel, if they can improve service then maybe there's hope to compete with their neighbors.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was staying at this hotel for a week. The room we got is quite small, which is not worth the price. There's a bigger room at the nearby hotel for the same price but the hotel was fully booked. In terms of location, it's perfect. Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia are just across the bridge. There's no need to use taxis if you're planning to wander around at the Thamrin area. In terms of cleanliness, i find the hotel to be quite hygine and the room service is just nice. We once ordered for food by the room service, the food and service were wonderful. We didn't wait for too long. However, there were problems when we checked out. We ordered for taxi to the airport the day before but the taxi was not available saying it's not in the system. The only taxi is the normal, small one which wouldn't fit our luggages. They were saying we didn't mention the specific car we wanted, sure it's our mistake but then they never asked to double check. 30 mins later, they provided us with an Alphard van from the Mandarin Oriental hotel with a special price! It's their way to compensate. Good thing that we made it to the airport on time. Oh, the bellboy was not available on that day. we called twice! we waited for so long that we decided to bring our luggages to the ground floor by ourselves. Bad service for the bellboy. It's not something we would expect from a 5 stars hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I called 2 weeks in advance to specially request for a connecting room as we have children. When we arrived the connecting room was taken.not available on arrival.I have unpleasant experience at the hotel restaurant.. During breakfast, accord card members get a 50% discount for a second adult. But for my child of 11 years who is also an accord member,he only get a 25% discount. It doesn;t make sense. Its more expensive for one adult one child than 2 adults having breakfast. An analogy, a kids meal at McDonald s more expensive than a value meal.I complained to the staff at the restaurant and they were not happy. One staff by the name of Mary who was on duty on 30/5/13 even challenged to complain to the hotel management.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I arrived at hotel at 1PM which was only 1 hour towards the check in time. but not allowed to check in. And I am pretty sure they have rooms available.And we booked for deluxe non smoking room and we got smoking room instead. But overall was okay. the food also quite nice
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location is great, there are malls and supermarket nearby. I stayed at a 21 sqm superior room, the actual usable area is about 70%, generally I didn't feel relaxing inside the room. If you are just looking for B&B in good location, I would recommend this hotel.At mid-night 2 to 3am, wifi connection was not consistent, it could be an occasional incident.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've stayed at this hotel twice, once last year and once as recent as lat week. I am a little disappointed that the renovations are still not completed. The rooms are also small by Pullman standards.Location-wise, it is good, being opposite to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staffModern, clean, great breakfast, good staff
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for 4 nights..the staffs were helpful and nice.Breakfast was ok. The below point was for the room I stayed for the last 2 nights, it was at 11th floor but very noise with the vehichles down street, the windows should have to be fixed otherwise no one would stay there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Have to say everything about this hotel was good. The entrance and the welcome sets the tone. Reception, the staff were efficient and incredibly friendly. The room although smaller than expected was clean and very comfortable.There was absolutely nothing I could find fault with. The location too was ideal.Definitely recommend this hotel if staying in central Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

good & clean hotel, very close with shopping mall & in the center district, so easy to go anywhere.The hotel with friendly & helpful staffs.But the bed size is too small for a couple only 160 cm width, so we cannot sleep well
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had twin bed room as king bed was not available and possibly that was from my reservation choice. Beds size too small. My room was connecting room to other room and I can clearly hear all conversation from other room. It is privacy issue and also not good for sleep. Traffic noise (when there is heavy vehicle) from road side sometime penetrates to room but not always.Everything else was well and good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic location and great service, stayed there late last year and came back in March for drinks. Always great service and good feature. The bedroom was very comfortable, all amenities and breakfast choice was amazing...one of the best breakfast I had so far. The best would be the location, just next door to Grand Indonesia and the BDC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is undoubtable strategic at the business location. Very good hotel services, from entrance, easy and fast checking reception. Even though the room is minimalist, but it is equipped with amenities and suitable for working. Bed room and bath room is split by wall glass. Convenience bed room and clean bathroom. The location is strategically at the business district. I like the hotel for the location, services and value of money.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Booked from rajakamar for a deluxe king, upgraded to junior suite upon check in (a late check in though, around 6 pm). receptionist was friendly and efficient, the hotel is in the mid of renovation with only 2 elevators operating. not a huge deal though, could hardly hear any sound from the room, probably because the suite is located at the very far end of the hall. location is great,with Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia just across the road but the overpass was dodgy with people selling stuff on either sides of the walking path. the room itself is quite clean, with a small dining table, lounge area and a tiny kitchen. not satisfied with the size of the bed though, i thought it would be king sized, not queen sized for a suite.breakfast was a variety of japanese, indonesian and western selections. funny thing was everything ran out at about 9 am, so grab your seats early, or have to wait a while for refill.check out was fairly quick, overall i would come back again if i dont bring my 1.5yr, otherwise would have to go through pain carrying stroller up and down the overpass (note : be prepared for lots of stairs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the location is great, within 5 minutes walking distance you will find three big shopping malls. EX, Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia. I love the swimming pool, the water is not cold! The most amazing thing is the breakfast spread, variety of delicious bread and pastries, local food, cold cuts and cereal bar.The room was surprisingly not too small, the size is okay and comfortable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had previously stayed here when it was a Nikko Hotel so was hoping more of the Pullman touches had been added.However, they have only really just begun to renovate with a temporary lobby on the 2nd floor and the rooms unchanged from when it was a Nikko Hotel.It's still a good Hotel, even though the rooms are a bit small and it will no doubt be exceptional once the renovations are complete.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

the location is great. Near 2 big malls. The cleanliness is very good. the pool very clean. But the waitress in the restaurant, not quite friendly or lack of smile. overall its a very good hotel for business travel or with your family...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite this hotel's excellent location and competitive rates prospective guests should be cautioned that the hotel appears to going through a soft re-opening. Renovations are underway and staff are not uniformly well trained. The e-mail confirmation of my reservation addressed me by two different names due apparently to a communications glitch. We had a poor experience at check in when reception gave confusing information about our room availability resulting in an unnecessarily long delay. The superior room is very nice and spacious but the decor is throughout the hotel is overly dark. Breakfast was very good. The spa is excellent but the pool is not especially welcoming. Most taxis seem to know the hotel by its old name Nikko.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second time staying at this hotel and I must say it is improving a lot in terms of service. I was staying there in regards to attend my very best friend's wedding. Got a room facing to Plaza Indonesia...not really spacious but sufficient for me. Welcome girl at lobby landing area is so friendly and always willing to help me with all my queries. Unfortunately I forgot her name. She always smiles and greets me by name. Room service was good. Breakfast is another joy! Love everything about it! Location is the best. Right in entertainment district. Reception is okay. will definitely stay again at this hotel when I return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is very good for its pricing and location, but room space is very limited.If you bring child, better to choose another hotel.If you are planning to go into shopping mall across the road (plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia) you need to walk across the road via bridge, and it might be a bit dangerous to walk the bridge after 9 pm.If you need to stay in this area, pullman sudirman is good for its rate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good hotel. Excellent location. Efficient, extremely well-mannered and friendly staff. The Superior Queen room we occupied had all amenities you would expect from a 5-star hotel, except for size. A few extra square meters would be welcome and are expected in such a place. Pity... On the whole my partner and I had a pleasant stay there. This hotel is ideally situated in Thamrin, central Jakarta business district, and within walking distance of several high-end shopping-malls. We might come back but go for another and larger room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon checking to the hotel, the security and porter were friendly.However the Front Office staff that served us was not so friendly, seemed like having not enough information for questions that we asked, especially I am an Accor Advantage Platinum holder.The initial room that she allocated to us were extremely small, more like a Tune Hotel.Luckily, the room was not smoke-free, that is why we were allocated another room, same type but bigger. Why she didn't allocate that room to us in the first place since we had mentioned we are Accor platinum holder??The breakfast was sumptous, has lot of menu from Indonesian to Japanese and American breakfast.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Great hotel and location, nice to see Pullman renovating the old Nikko hotel.Great services super helpful staff. Hotel on the way to getting that new again groovey feel.Rooms a little boxey with that Japanese hotel feel.Easy stroll to Plaza Indonesia for shopping.Cool bathroom but some furnishings tatty.Great gym and spa. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is good for the location - it's only minutes away from the Grand Indo mall. Stayed for 2 nights in April, the room was not spacious but big enough for 3 of us. Overall cleanliness was good and for the price we paid I'd say it is pretty reasonable. I didn't get a chance to check out other facilities in the hotel but it was a good experience in general.Also note that the hotel is under renovation so there are only 2 operating lifts - not for the impatient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed in Pullman Central on 9/2/2013. Location is good, opposite 2 malls - Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia. Sunday was a car free day and it was quite an experience to blend in the crowd. Hotel service is impeccable. Room is a bit small but sufficient. Staff can arrange for car/taxi.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Found a dead cockroach in the bathroomProblem of water leakage from bathroom the hallwayStill the same common problem with the other Pullman (Dubai Deira), shortage of shower gel and insufficient restock on the next day if the housekeeping saw you still having half empty bottle of the shower gelThe hotel is still under renovationThe breakfast buffet was very good, nice location
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first experience stay in Pullman Thamrin. I stay with my family during weekend and our objectives were to enjoy the hotel and 'experience' to see Bundaran HI view from our room. We stay in deluxe suite, it was nice with modern design and amenities. There were coffee machine and brewed tea in the room; which I like very much. Bathroom separate by glass wall which can covered by curtain for privacy, and it gives impression of larger room space - nice trick. Gym and pool were good, compact in size yet provide various type for excercise; as well as their sauna - jacuzi in women room. Breakfast was fine, various and standard you can expect from five star hotel.Unfortunately we dont get the room facing Jl Thamrin - Bunderan HI. When we check in, reception said single bed non smooking room as we wish only available with view of backside Jl Thamrin. We may had room excatly as we expected if we are willing to wait another 1.5 hours after cleaning finalize. Thus we achieve our first objective but bit miss in second one ;)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Used to be great but just plain bad now. Clean rooms and great location (but there are many other great hotels in central Jakarta) but the service is just rubbish. This is marketed as a five star hotel but it is more like a 3 star hotel with zero service culture. This hotel used to be Nikko and it was fantastic then... Now it's just shocking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had lunch after check in at 1.30 pm and it was so tasty. Breakfast buffet offered a wide variety from Indonesia food to western food. Staffs are friendly and professional. Hotel was across from major shopping complex and very easy to get good dinner there. The area was also quite safe. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Thamrin is a great hotel in a superb location. Two of the best shopping malls in Jakarta are just across the street (Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia). You can just walk and take the overhead crossing just opposite the lobby to get to the malls. The rooms are slightly smaller but are newly renovated and modern looking. TV channels selections are great too. I agree with one of the reviewer who said that more efforts can be put to clean the bathroom though.The staffs are friendly and helpful too.The breakfast is excellent and delicious. Its better than what i've expected actually. They are currently doing a renovation on the 1st floor and the hotel reception is located on the 2nd floor. Im sure the lobby will look great once they are finished with the renovation work. small note to the hotel management: in the back carpark 2nd floor on the same level as the hotel walkway, i saw a bunch of guys about 5 of them (seems to be chauffeur driver) playing cards and behaving rowdily behind a car. I'm not suggesting that they are gambling in public, probably just a card game killing time while waiting to pick up their masters. But wouldn't it be better if the carpark security guards ask them to play in the drivers room or something. It would retain the "clean" and "safe" image of the hotel. This is after all a 5 star hotel not pasar tanah abang. Thanks :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a good stay at the Pullman hotel in Thamrin. It's very accessible to places you want to go and commuting from and to the hotel is easy. At night, though the place is by a busy street, sleeping was not a problem. Staff were cheerful and helpfulThe buffet spread might need an "ahmp!" or some additional dish to make it more interesting rather than a usual hotel breakfast menu.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Service is top as you can expect in that value hotel.Room view (I was on street view) was amazing.Breaffast buffet is awesome even it is much expensive as the offer deal I took was without breakfast.The cleaning of the bathroom could be better...They also did not take my debit card at reception which was not convenient at breakfast or others things you want to lodge to the room bill (as usually done).Only credit card are accepted
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good hotel if you are looking for an affordable stay right in the middle of Jakarta. I'm sure it is better value than its neighbours on all sides and the hotel facilities are top standard. As a business traveller that utilises the fitness wellness facilities I can say this is one of the better gyms I have seen in a hotel this age. Currently under renovation means that the ground floor lobby is closed and you need to take lift to temporary reception on level 2 and no real lobby lounge but this is a small setback and the renovations are set for completion late 2013 I think. Rooms in the main wing are small but clean. Stupid glass bathroom as is the norm nowadays bit a good block out curtain ensures privacy if you are travelling with friends or family. Internet for 2 devices bit a bit slow if you need downloads. I would stay again just for the fitness centre.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room is clean, quiet, various tv channels just that bathroon room swings inside, which made the bathroom seem smaller. The water sound from above floor can be clearly heard from a ventilation box at the room door ceiling, which can be pretty loud especially at night. Electricity in my room tripped twice in the night but it went back on instantly so perhaps should look into this. Wifi in the room is not so stable as my instant messages were not received. Hotel located in prime area with walking distance to malls. I've seen a lot of Japanese tourist, if not, on biz trip meeting up at the hotel lounge & lobby as I was told it was formerly Nikko Hotel. Reception staff are equally English proficient so no worries about communication. Variety style for buffet breakfast i.e. asian & western. Didn't get to use other facilities due to a rather short trip but overall i'm happy with the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

No, seriously, I am not that much pampered by hotels, but Pullman really shifted my impression and idea of what a hotel may look like.Very polite and smiling staff, everyone is helpful. It really looks like people enjoy their job. PEOPLE SPEAK DECENT ENGLISH! It's Indonesia after all. The room was pretty good, everything is in its place. Yes, they forgot to replenish the minibar, but not really a big deal.In short, I felt like I touched the unreachable world of premium (platinum, VIP, superb, etc etc) hotels, which is not commonly available for mortals. Will definitely stay again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventhough there is no easy direct access to Plaza Indonesia for food court or shopping, you can use the bridge. Advisable during working hours (daytime) only to walk across.Service is good but definitely a small room but enough for 2 persons.Drawback is the bathroom door swing inside which make it real tight space inside the bathroom and I had to ask staff to replace the shower curtain (pretty smelly) and a real bad ventilation inside the bathroom. I wish the bathroom door is swing outside instead of inside the bathroom.Plenty of choices for breakfast but taste is far off than nearby Kempisky or Grand Hyatt hotels.Personally, the mattress is a bit too hard for a comfy sleep.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our friends stayed at Pullman Hotel Jakarta and the room was a studio bedroom which they paid USD160. The room was very good value for money and clean. The service was excellent and the location very good. Given the price of hotels in Jakarta currently, this was a very good deal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

not bad overall the room is rather small but cosy.service of staff is also courteous and friendly.the bed is relatively large enough for me to sleep.they have large range of cable tv channels.the wifi signal strength is rather not stable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Is was my first visit to Jakarta and I was not disappointed. The hotel was opposite a fantastic shopping mall. The rooms were well appointed with all the facilities and amenities you need. Securiy in and out of the hotel seemed excessive until you experience the same process in every hotel and mall in Jakarta. I guess it is better to have the extra safety measure. Staff were all very helpful from start to finish of my stay. Very happy indeed
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay at this hotel for arrange Japan visa. Japan embassy located just opposite to this hotel or around 5 minutes by walking. Moreover, two beautiful malls stand around there which were Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. During reservation i had been noticed that the hotel was under renovation, so i was worried that my staying will be distracted with that. All of my doubtfulness gone, i never been felt distracted whereas the hotel is under renovation.Hotel 1st floor was under renovation, so check in/out was in 2nd floor. Reception staff was very friendly, and not so long i got my room number. My room was upgraded since i was accor advantages plus gold member. Room are very spacious for deluxe level. I love the room layout, and for design were simple and elegant. Cleanliness of room and bathroom were well maintained. amenities provided was good enough; slippers, shavers, hair dryer, dental kit, etc.My request for local newspaper when i made online reservation was fulfilled.Only two issues about this hotel. First, i was bit dissapointed as a member that welcome fruit and welcome gift was not delivered directly, until i ask for having this things. Second, i ask to have a bell boy to pick up some of my baggages, and i need to wait about 15 minutes. Welcome fruit given: Orange, Apple, Pear were good, sweet and fresh, and i love the taste of maccaron given as welcome gift. for improvement i would recommend if guest couldothers than that, all were meet my expectations, will be back soon with the new touch after renovation!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I enjoy the stay at this hotel and would recommend everyone to stay here when you are in Jakarta. The hotel is well located nearby the business district centre as well as the main shopping mall in town. I love the hotel gym and recreation facilities. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel is in a great location right in the heart of Jakarta, lots of things to see and do in the evenings. The hotel itself is nicely re furbished with good facilities in the rooms - the room may be a bit small but that is only a very minor thing. The breakfast was excellent, the lounge area very good and the staff could not be faulted in any way. If I had to stay in Jakarta again I would go back for sure, it's the best all rounder that I have found.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Room layout is perfect. We were lucky to have given the room with Jalan Thamrin view. Something different and spectacular for country people like us. The staff were helpful and friendly. Bought takeaway Padangnese food, put them in the fridge and I kindly asked the staff from "room service" to reheat them for me. When they come back with my reheated food, oh boy, I didn't just have reheated food, but my food was well presented. I was so impressed. Thank you very much!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 4 nights, modern but small rooms. FO desk staff close to useless with basic business requests (i.e. scanning "1" page and emailing it to address on business card) - took 30 minutes and expected me to pay for it. Coffee a joke a in the restaurant (homestyle espresso machine), breakfast is open till 10am during the week - be prepared that clearing starts at 09:30am. Completely outdated business centre with 10 year plus old printers/scanners whit unreliable functionality. Will be staying at the new Pullman as this hotel does not live up to its name. Main factors poor management rather than the product.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at the Pullman and got upgraded to a suite because they were full when we checked in late in the evening. The price was very resonable for the location just across the street from the Grand Hyatt. Very close to several shopping malls for dining also. It was about a $20 cab ride from the airport in the evening. Use silver bird and pay by meter - don't charge to your hotel. Try the Palalada restraurant in the Grand Indonesia shopping mall. The staff was very friendly and internet decent (and free). We are trying the spa this afternoon before getting on our flight. We would stay here again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for business trip to Jakarta. Having used for business meetings, breakfast, luncheon, spa, bar and hub to move around (very near to mega malls), I really appreciated the value the hotel provides, especially in terms of cost. Some additional tips/info I can give you if you are stsying here is 1)taxi driver may recognize better by its old name "Nikko Hotel", 2) it is under renovation work, therefore some function may not be sufficient (e.g. Number of lifts under operation), 3) the hotel is VERY popular among Japanese especially budinessmen. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room is very clean..I like the shower bath...The kids like to swim here..Location very good just opposite Plaza Indonesia..Everything is in good condition except the esspresso machine is not working..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My title pretty much says it all. Hotel's location can't be beat, just across 2 major shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia). Room is small but adequate for my two nights sleep but my gripe is with the misrepresentation on the Accorhotels website. It was stated that superior rooms has king-sized bed but instead we were offered queen-sized. When we asked about the discrepancy, the reply given was "the other rooms with king-sized beds are being renovated". We were unhappy with the reply but very satisfied with the counter staff who spoke to us as she remained polite and apologetic throughout. We hope there would be no further misrepresentation on the Accorhotels website in the future as it can be pretty frustrating when one is anticipating something (as stated) and later made to accept something different.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very friendly staff across the hotel, especially at reception and in the restaurant. Always very helpful and prepared to assist with any request.The restaurant offers a wide selection of western and Asian dishes, including Japanese food - as this hotel seems to be popular with Japanese visitiors.Swimming pool, and spa are also of a very high quality. Of the five, 5* hotels i have stayed in Jakarta, this is the best, despite not looking glamourous on the outside.Will look forward to going again soon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Must stay hotel if you are in jakarta.Located at central jakarta, just walking distance to bundaran HI or Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.Easy access by busway( oposite the hotel) You can easily going anywhere from here.Try the kahyangan restaurant, one of the best shabu restaurant in jakarta.If you looking for a great street foods, try to walk around grand indonesia at night its alot of strets fooda there. Or go to sarinah plaza and find nasi goreng( fried rice's ) gila there. There is money changer at 2nd floor with Very Good rate in jakarta.This hotel was named NIKO before, so no surprise its alot of Japanese. In this hotel. But still this is one of my favorite, off course with new accor brand : Pullman its seem that they give us much more Better with service and room quality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

with this hotel I enjoyed a very comfortable sleep in a spacious room, the variety of breakfast menus are fantastic.... And the location is just that good, right in the heart of Jakarta, moreover the price was quite the value for a luxury of a 5-star hotel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything about the hotel is great. Its comfortable, well equipped with good service. The location is god from one perspective but not for connecting to the main road around Jakarta. Traffic outside the hotel is crazy throughout the week days.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose the Pullman because of its proximity to the Thamrin Business District and its price point I was very happy with my five day stay - the staff throughout the hotel were excellent and the room was an adequate size for my needs and comfortable. A number of reviews have commented on the slow Internet connection and intermittent water pressure when showering. Yes I encountered both but neither was a real headache and the wifi connection is free. The outdoor pool is very nice and the two large shopping malls being just across the road are very handy for dining and shopping. I would definitely stay here again. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been staying at this hotel for about 5 years, when it was the Nikko and now as the Accor-owned Pullman. You can see how the Accor touch is already having a positive effect, and yet it is also good to see some long-standing staff here who recognise me and are always friendly.However, the price has risen 50% in the last 3 years, and it is not yet fully justified. The basic rooms look good but are rather cramped (the furniture does not quite fit in the space). The internet is free (as it should be in this day and age) but it is a very slow and unreliable connection - inexcusable now that Jakarta has good access to major internet networks.It is in a great location, and I imagine the new lobby will look good when it is finished (it is currently being refurbished). The gym is excellent.I expect the place will get better and become even more popular, and sadly that means it will also become more expensive - probably too much for my modest corporate budget. Jakarta lacks mid-priced hotels, and I am not sure this Pullman can compete at the higher end with the likes of Four Seasons and Mandarin, so I do hope it does not stray far from its roots.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is the previous Nikko, and is undergoing extensive renovations. But the rooms are well-appointed with all that you need as a business traveller except the lack of a clock. There is no where in the room that tells you the local time, and I think for an international traveller, that is essential. No doubt we can refer to our laptops, smart phones, but still having the local time in the room is helpful.There are two things that I was very impressed with - the audio knob in the bathroom actually works! And it's adjustable! I've stayed in many hotels, probably in the hundreds, in my lifetime, but this is the first hotel that has the sound system in the bathroom that is working and you can adjust the volume! Most of the time, it's not working, or if it is the volume adjustment is broken..Hopefully it's not due to the dampness in the bathroom that cause all those systems to fail after some time, so hopefully the next time I return to Jakarta, I'll still be able to watch a movie from the bathtub!The second is the huge fluffy square pillows - they are extremely comfortable. I'm going to get a couple of those when I get home.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

it is okay and nothing great . Thes ervice was okay and it is close to the biggest mall.The security seems to be intimidating. Good location and good food.Nothing much for vegeterains . the bar is not exciting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven`t stayed at this hotel, just walked in out of curiosity. It`s one of the least appealing hotels Ive ever been in asthetically speaking. You walk through the unappealing lobby and the equally unappealing restaurant to reach the cigar/wine bar, then turn around and walk back out. can`t imagine room rates are too high. it may serve as a functional bed for the night kind of place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LocationRight in the centre of Jakarta across the road to a mega size shopping mall called Grand Indonesia shopping Centre and also near another shopping mall called Plaza. From the airport it is located 1hour (in traffic) 30 minutes (no traffic). Plenty of shops and entertainment within the area. RoomRoom (901) was very nice, cosy and featured a large kitchen, living room table for four, a modern couch, large comfortable double bed and large (42inch) TV. The bathroom featured a shower cubicle with rain shower and separate head as well as a bath with another separate shower head for convenient rinsing. Standard window to bedroom bathroom. Water was hot and powerful, with generous variety of amenities with shower products from Roger Gallet. The room and bathroom had a modern artistic decor with stylish finish and all was immacuetly clean. There was also large cabinet which has generous storage place for clothes for two guests. Kitchen ware was of good quality and a large standard upright fridge was also there.Bed is quite soft with feather pillows and slept comfortably. There is a switch to control all lighting in the room, in which initially was confusing thinking all lamps will turn off but one must get up and turn these off manually. Many nice lighting options though. Facilities There were 3 restaurants, only had a meeting in the cafe which was comfortable and faces large windows with a nice view of the traffic. There is also an outdoor swimming pool with pool bar but did have time to visit. Food though was good quality. StaffStaff offer the high level Indonesian hospitality with smiles, bows and general friendliness all round. Check-in was smooth but check-out took a while with a line due to only one staff member.Overall room was cosy with an interesting layout, location was perfect to be in central Jakarta and staff maintained the high level of Indonesian hospitality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything on my stay was great at this newly renovated hotel, including the service and quality of room service food.However, the hot water pressure was intermittent on all 3 occasions I showered. It alternate between from very cold to very hot, and I suspect it has got to do with inconsistant hot water pressure. It was always a "shower dancing" session. Jumping out of the water whenever it turns cold. (I stayed at 11th floor, the top premier-room floor). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, very convinient in the city. Nearby to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia Mall. The Hotel is at moment under renovation, lobby on first floor. The rooms in old part of Hotel are small, well it was build from japanese for japanese, but all necessary things are available in room. Nice bathroom with window to room. Comfy bed, maybe bit hard but ok. Every morning a newspaper at room door. Restaurant veeery good. Breakfast buffet a wide range , from western, indonesian, indian and japanese food. Well the hotel bar is not there in moment due to the renovation process. The new Hotel pool is very big and you can swim your kilometers. Coming back factor? Yes!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Typical quality business hotel. Needs a refresh , for eample I cut my thigh on a broken corner of the desk in the room which was chipped. not much to do locally but go to the shops. Staff very friendly and helpfull staffwe enjoyed our stay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best thing about this hotel is its location. As many have mentioned the mega malls are just across the street. It is a fairly new hotel and in fact the L1 is still being refurbished. Buffet breakfast was okay and they have a wine a cigar bar which is a plus. Did not use the pool and the gym so I cannot comment. The bed and pillows are nice and very comfortable. Chose a room facing away from Main Street if you are bothered by street noise. Bathroom is reasonable size and toiletries are standard. I was staying at a premier room so I had a separate siting room and 2 flat panel TVs which was niceIn room wires connection were reasonably fast and stable and was free overall I was satisfied with the stay and would come back but do have a couple of dislikes. One is the bathroom bowl area is way too small. There is virtually any space to put anything on it. The water pressure in my room was poor and the hot water is slow in activating. Maybe if is because I am on the 11th floor which is the top floor. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A very good hotel,previous Nikko hotel and since under Accor rebranded Pullman. Typical french design hotel,good taste. Rooms very confortable but since located in one of the most centric streets of Jkt can be a bit noisy since air con is very silent. Located in front of two of most hyper malls of Jkt. Very well equipped gym and nice pool.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best hotel that I've ever stay at hotel, Everything is very good, Nice/friendly staff, Clean room and large room, Have nice bathtub, Good view from the room ( Bundaran HI view ), Good location ( near from bundaran HI, plaza indonesia, grand indonesia, sarinah thamrin, monas, gambir station ), Delicious food.... Recommended hotel... We will stay here again next time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here for one night (2-3 January 2013) with my fams.. The hotel is Good,it's just take a few minutes walking from Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia mall through the bridge. The food in the hotel is very delicious.. They served so many kind of food,from Indonesia,japan,India,western,and many more. The room is not too large,but it's so clean and comfortable.. Oh yeah, I like the gym center so much because all of the fitness equipment is so modern.. Just stay at here with no worry :D
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good location , right in the center of Jakarta . Perfect for shopping and visit the city. Room a little bit small , very nice and professionnal staff . Good food , swimming pool , sauna , gym etc... But many indonesian families stay there with kids screaming and playing in corridors or elevators at any time of the day , and of course very early in the morning. The point is that parents and staff of hotel don't really care about trouble caused. Very bad education ! For this only reason I think I will never go back there !
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely one of my favorite location to stay in jakarta!!!You can just cross the street and you reach 3 of the biggest and best shopping malls in jakarta.Rooms are clean and nice.I loved the pool on the roof and especially the gym!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best thing about this hotel is it's location -- right on the HI circle and just a crossing bridge away from Plaza Indonesia. The second best thing is that it's much more affordable than the three other hotels right on the HI circle and minutes away from Plaza or Grand Indonesia. The third best thing is that it has a decent gym and swimming pool, and they serve tasty food for their breakfast buffets, which can't be said about many other hotels in Jakarta. Also, it's very clean with friendly and helpful staff.Really the only down side is that it's not super luxurious and the regular rooms are small, but again you get what you pay for.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you to LE CLUB ACCOR, who give me discount.Room is good, quite and my family are enjoyed this stay. Everything are good except TV channel are not so clear and hope will give more discount during holiday season.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

me and my spouse decided to stay at pullman jakarta when we got stuck with jakarta's famous traffic jam because of the flood earlier this week. it's our first as a go-show guest, fortunately the staff were great and helped us to get a room for 1 night. it's a little bit pricey but the atmosphere made it paid.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good service but too noisy. I can hear the sound of opening/closing door from the other room.The hotel crew is so helpfull and friendly. The bed is very comfort.Great location. Good choice if you like to shopping.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just walk to the 2 big malls, but u have to across thebridge and so tiring if u go With family but taxi Can take u near or far. Superior Room not too good ITS too expensive comparing With other hotel. Stay deluxe or suite thats best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second times i stayed in pullman hotel. First times was in pullman CP that i felt room decoration is very strange for me.Overall i really like this hotel, their rooms decoration is nice and modern but still in normal ( i mean shower / bathtub in same area with toilet, not like pullman CP decoration ), have a big sofa that can used for my son nanny to slept on that.Have a wife connection makes me can play with my ipad although the internet speed not as fast as harris kelapa gading.For me one minor minus point in room is the pillow is too big, i dont know what function is that big pillow because it makes difficult to hug it.I also tried the gym and swimming pools, also the sauna room, every thing is above my first expectation from this hotel. The pools is big with blue clear water, and i really glad that their have children pools area that very suitable for my baby boy. The water conditon is not too cold with a less wind blows ( i think it because their pools area only at second floor )And i have dinner in olive tree restaurant, an all u can eat buffet, foods variety is average, less than syailendra (jw marriot) but u can find more japanesse food here. The taste is oke, although once again i more like syailendra. But the ambience and view from olive tree is much better. From here u can see thamrin road and plasa indonesia.The check in and check out process is fast with a friendly and helpfull staff.Thats is all the good things i remember about this hotel.Now i want to say the bad things that this hotel must improved. I never saw the 5 star hotel with difficult parking space like this hotel. In open space, behind the hotel many area was closed by rope or block. And when i tried to park in anex building, many placed was closed too by reserved parking. It is lucky for me check in on saturday, so i still get a space near P2 that is near connect to hotel. I can't imagine if i want to stayed here on sunday or weekday in office hour. For information every sunday, annex building that always used by JPCC Church so the parking area will be full.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed here early December and booked an executive room after having read the reviews that standard rooms are very small. Stayed here 2 nights and could not extend because the hotel was overbooked.I would like to start with the positive experience:- The location cannot be better. 5 minute walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.- Breakfast is really good and is definitely 5 star level- Staff is friendly- 3 pieces of laundry per day free of chargeThe more negative experience:- I asked for a non-smoking room twice and that was approved. In the night I turned off the AC and realized that it is a smoker room- A coffee machine is provided. Yet, seems to be very cheap material. It was exchanged three times and still did not work.- Wired internet connection did not work and WIFI was quite slow- The room was rather "old" and needs to be refurbished. Not cozy and not good value! - I returned after work at around 4pm to the room and it was not cleaned yet. The cleaning service came after 4pm and I rejected because I did not want to be disturbed.In sum I have to say that the Hotel has potential but I did not feel cozy and thus did not find it a good value for money. Particularly if you compare it to other Hotels in Jakarta in a similar price range.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Had a skeptical thought of staying in pullman jakarta after reading many reviews. This will be my first visit to jakarta. Pullman is located strategically at the heart of jakarta,.where all the high end shopping mall are located. I reach jakarta on Friday afternoon and it took me 1.5hrs to reach the hotel where i had spend most of my time in the massive traffic jammed. Pullman hotel are currently having a renovation, but it doesn't affect my stay. My visit to pullman are being overwhelmed by the charm and hospitality of the staff. The negative side of the service, it took me more than 2 hours to get a room. After a long flight and being stuck in a traffic jammed, the last thing you won't want is to be stuck in the lobby waiting for your room. i reach the hotel around 2pm and my room is only ready around 4pm. I told the receptionist to contact me when the room is ready but there seem to be forgotten about it. The room is good. I did requested for a new refurbished room, higher floor and away from the lift lobby. To my surprise, there really give me what i had requested. I have no complained about the room. Room is pretty small but it is OK for a single traveler and the room service is good as well. The wall seem to be very thin. You can hear a conversation of someone in the corridors. I won't mind staying in pullman jakarta again but the traffic situation in Jakarta may make me think twice about choosing any hotel in Jln Thamrin again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

pullman hotel in thamrin is located right in the center of the thamrin area. this is the district where the upper elements of indonesia showcase their personal wares.here you will never feel like you are in a third world country.the hotel has very good staff. they are always willing to extend an arm to their guests. it also has a nice pool, spa and gym. I would suggest one take a room facing thamrin street to get a view of how busy thamrin is. the only downside is you have to cross the street from the ritzy malls to get back to the hotel .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This time i went to Jakarta for bussiness and pleasure. After upgrading my room using my accoradvantage member, i found the room is just perfect. It has a living room so i can have a relax-nice-meeting with my creative designer there. With a nice view of Bundaran HI. Going to Plaza Indonesia, that famous mall, is also easy. Just cross the street and the bridge is in front of the hotel, means bye traffic jam :)) The quality of the food for breakfast is good. The staffs are nice. I recommend this hotel and will put this hotel as my first choice whenever i go to Jakarta! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The great impression of this hotel was firendly, convience, helpful, respect and with high standard of security services. I felt really secure and safe in and out of the hotel permisses. Security staff not only performed thier atmost role and also extreme fiendly and helpful. All receptional staff including customer relation manager were highly experience in their role of business.I really love to come back and stay in this hotel again early next year.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was previously Nikko Hotel. Perfect location since it is located in the central of Jakarta. Clean room + good hotel service. A walking distance to Grand Indonesia Mall and another 5- 10 minutes walk to fastfood outlets such as McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. Nearby to Rumah Berseh Sihat Spa and Tanah Abang. it would be great if the internet speed can be upgraded. Overall, I'm satisfied with my stay here in Pullman Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

will deifnitely stay here again because of it central location ,friendly staff and excellent club facilities.The buffet breakfast is very varied and delicious. Once the renovations are over I am sure it will deserve the 5 star rating.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good hotel service and room facilities. Friendly hotel staff. Would be great if Internet speed could be improved. Great nearby amenities to Centralpark shopping mall and is easy to find good food and shops.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this hotel previous years ago when its name was still Nikko Hotel. They had good service and facility. But if you would like to get a romantic moment in here, you will not get it in here. This hotel is best for business purpose since the location is in central business district of Jakarta. The surrounding area was crowded and traffic jam occur until late night. But, for shopping lover, you can easily reach to Grand Indonesia Mall by walking. It's a very big and famous shopping mall, and you might be love it (especially for women) :).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It's one of the nice hotels in good location, which is easy to access to shopping area. The only down side is the lift access to Executive floor which I believe that will be better once hotel renovation is completed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a Hilton Gold, Sheraton Gold, Hyatt Platinum member and wanted to try the new Pullman Hotel just across the Grand Hyatt. I was served by the duty manager, Karsim who was there to process the registration. He did the usual documentation but what shocked me greatly was his prompt reply to reject my request to ask for a later checkout. He was so quick in rejecting, I wondered if he has a script to do so. Despite my repeated plea, he was undetered and terribly cold and assertive. The room was horrible! The carpet and the floor was dusty. The bedsheet had a foul smell, the bathroom drainage system was choked, the toilet bowl was dark in colour and the coffee maker was damage despite changing twice.I have stayed in other Pullman properties before but this is far from my wildest imagination. I can understand if the front desk staff who served me is a junior staff but if the manager is of such standard, I seriously wonder the attitude of the others.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Personally I really enjoyed this hotel. It was more in a downtown area with areas to go right outside it. The hotel itself might not be as good as the Pullman Central Park, but the location makes a big difference to me. The breakfast and gym were both better than the Pullman Central Park also.The only con I would have is that this is an average hotel for rooms. They have been doing a lot of work and currently still doing it. I never heard any of the renovations but there is a slight detour on how to leave because of it. After all the renovations I am sure this hotel will be a spot to seriously consider when going to Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman hotel welcomes you with a very large hall, which felt like a desert as there were no people around.When I went there, the facility had just been taken over by Pullman from the previous company. As such, the room was kind of stinky because of the renovation works. The interior design was quite good, though.Breakfast was noteworthy for the variety of food.Overall not recommended, considering the other options right next to it Grand Hyatt, Chinese Mandarin, Kempinski)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in an Executive Room that looks like a Superior Room. Average hotel room and the Staff Service was their saving glory and I must say the location of the hotel was good and even the Oak Room is a great place to lounge in the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very good value for money business oriented hotel with high quality amenities and services. We were in Jakarta for almost two weeks and the Pullman was a great choice for us. Service is top notch, friendly, very helpful and professional. Some of the much higher priced "palaces" might offer glamorous surroundings, but the Pullman has everything you need and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for it. Check in was quick and smooth with smiles and helpful information. The rooms are rather compact (this property inherited the Japanese size rooms of the former Nikko), but are well laid out and cater to business requirements with a decent size desk and (not very) high speed free internet connection (cable or wifi). For a daily fee, higher speed internet is available. We did not try it. Wifi is available throughout the hotel and there is a well equipped business center (that charges for internet usage). In addition two free internet terminals are available in the lobby.The bathroom again is cramped, but very clean with nice toiletries available. our room had a combination bath/shower. Very annoyingly the shower stream, though acceptably strong, suffered from fluctuating water temperature. Beware of sudden cold or very hot water.Although our room faced the main street, insulation was good enough to block out most noise.A good point for longer staying guests is the effective laundry service at reasonable prices.We had a few breakfasts at the hotel buffet and it offers a relatively large choice of local, Asian and Western dishes, including eggs made to order. Having said that, the level of the food was pretty mundane. On the other hand, the Italian buffet at dinner was a hit. The hotel also has a good wine and cigar bar.The hotel is currently undergoing renovation of the main public spaces that will continue into 2013. We were not very affected by it and there was no noise in the rooms.High marks go also to the airy, modern, well equipped gym and to the excellent outdoor pool area. A colleague used the massage facilities on offer and reported great satisfaction. The hotel is very well located for the central city business district, although the massive traffic jams throughout town can make travel and keeping to schedule a nightmare."Executive class" Silverbird taxis are available at the hotel entrance 24 hours a day, but there is no problem in getting the regular, reliable and well maintained Bluebird taxis (at half the price) just outside the hotel.Every possible shopping need and many food outlets are available across the street (connected by a footbridge) at two high class malls adjacent to the Hyatt Hotel (Plaza Indonesia) and to the iconic Hotel Indonesia. If you are at the hotel on Sundays, the usually jam packed Jalan Thamrin is closed to motorized traffic between 05:00 and 11:00 am and taken over by pedestrians and bicycle riders.We will definitely and happily stay at this Pullman again and can recommend it unhesitatingly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Convenient location with 2 huge shopping complex on the other side of the road. Although ground floor is being renovated but no big problem.APPRECIATION1) Very high quality gym & jacuzzi facilities. Staff in the gym are very friendly & helpful.2) Wide variety of food options at breakfast with daily juice special3) Wide variety of TV channel options4) 2 iMac are available on 2/F for guest usage DISAPPOINTMENT1) Noisy room (Windows in the room is not really double shielded and the traffic noise is quite disturbing. Inter-connected room is noisy too. Another source of noise is the banging door by neighbours)2) Very BAD wifi connection (auto disconnect almost everytime I access / refresh a web page!)3) Reception counter is slow. I queued 15-min for someone reactivate my room card (hotel staff mistakenly set expiry date to one day earlier than my checkout date)4) On my first night of stay, a staff called me at 10:30pm and asked if I needed wake up call. Didn't she realize that she woke me up already?5) Jaccuzi & Sauna services closed too early (at 10pm)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

if you are looking for hotel for business and shopping. this hotel is your answer. this hotel is located at the heart of Jakarta. it's easy for meeting and shopping. however, this hotel is still under renovation. so it's quite noisy and uncomfortable in some functions such as restaurant, lobby,...etc. renovation will be finished around beginning of 2013. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I arrived late evening after a 20 hour journey and found my Executive Wing room had no Wireless network, although I'd been given a login and password for free Internet use at check-in. I carry a MacBook Air, which has no connection for an Internet cable, and I had 38 messages ready to send, which I'd worked on during my flight!I phoned reception to ask for help. The concierge who visited almost immediately was charming but unable to help. I then retired for the night, and found an excellent wireless connect when I went to breakfast in the restaurant. However, the big deal was that, when I returned to my room mid-morning, they had installed a wireless unit. So here I am reviewing the helpful service. To me, good service is meeting your travellers' real needs. That matters more than the slightly tired feel of the fittings and decor. After all, what I'm mainly here for is to sleep and, when I'm not sleeping, to be able to work. Actually, when I look at how much email I've received since setting up my connection, maybe the absence wasn't such a bad thing :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Checked in for a night stay at the Pullman Jakarta, previously known as Nikko Hotel.I arrived the hotel late, close to midnight.I booked my room through Agoda and unfortunately, I forgot to request for Non-smoking room.Upon checking in, the reception informed me that there were only smoking rooms left.As I have extremely sensitive nose, I always had trouble sleeping in a smoking room, even if housekeeping sprayed the room to reduce the scent.The reception was kind enough to upgrade me to a suite with the agreement that I will check out slightly earlier.I was more than happy with the deal and agreed to it.Breakfast was good. The spread was good and more importantly, the quality of the food.I checked out before 9am next morning.Keep up the good work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All seemed really nice to start with, lovely hotel, pleasant staff nice room and amenities. However the attention to detail of the cleaning staff was lacking, a small jug that had milk in it was left beside the kettle, the coffee was not replenished and it seemed like they rushed to clean the room.The big insult was when we asked for some milk for coffee and were advised we would have to pay for it! We do not drink black coffee, we do not use creamer and there was no milk provided in the fridge. Any other hotels around the world we have stayed at have always had milk for coffee...........Would we stay there again - probably not, would find another Jakarta hotel to stay at.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing this on the third night of my stay in this hotel. I stayed in an executive room on the 7th floor and the room was large and quiet. That's about the only really good thing i have to say about this hotel for which i have stayed in twice. Service quality is very poor. Specifically, staff are not trained well. Some examples:1. I showed my Accor card to a waitress before a meal and she said i was entitled to a 15% discount. At the end of the meal, she came to me and said that she was wrong and that it had to be an Accor Advantage card and not just an ordinary Accor card. I questioned that and the manager came and repeated what the waitress said. So their fault but i bear the penalty. Real smooth.2. I asked for the taxi counter to get me a taxi and as the taxi was driving up, some other guests just walked pass me and into the taxi. The service staff just said that the next taxi would be mine. Again, poor training and inability to control the situation. 3. When I ordered some food from the hotel bakery and the service staff was keying in the order into the cash machine, a phone call came in and the staff promptly answered the call and then left the cash machine to respond to whatever it was first before coming back to finish my transaction. So took me one minute to order, and i just stood there for 5 minutes waiting for the staff to return. 4. I had a visitor who came to the hotel reception and just stated my name and asked for my room number. And the reception just gave him my room number without calling my room first and asking me if i expected this visitor. Security lapses. Once again, this hotel has a good location and good facilities and rooms. Just the service staff is not trained well enough. If i may make a suggestion to the management, just go over to the hotel across the road (i.e. Hyatt) and just offer the staff there 20% more to join you and everything would improve.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

hotel going through remodeling phase..lobby is in disarray, dusty and dirty. Staff is disorganized and not very helpful. Need more people working at the checkin desk, long lines always. My stay was not very pleasant there, and trying to use the wifi was a headache..loose connection or weak signal always in the room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Jakarta is located in the heart of Jakarta with shoppong malls and restairants around. The hotel is a little bit worn out and reuqires rennovation. The standard rooms are very small, where can just walk around the bed. If available take the larger room with the relative surcharge. Beds are comfortable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

everything was nice...the suite room was very clean...and very nice...the swimming pool and fitness centre, i like everything in this hotel except for the lobby maybe because they renovate so they move it to 2nd floor..and they said all will finish next year...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are so many reasons to hate this hotel. Here are a few.... No reliable internet on the upper floors. No iron or ironing board in the rooms. No iron if you ask for one. Also, your keycard will only get you to your own floor. Bad luck if you're travelling with others, because getting somebody to buzz you onto ofther floors is tough. The bars are rubbish. The rooms are however, quite large and the cigar bar is good if you want to smoke. Also the place is fairly central. But this is a business hotel. And you might find doing business impossible here.Also, the breakfast wasn't as delicious as you might expect at a Pullman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall services are good, just need extra attention from staffs and find the way to avoid que at reception or at least there's Guest Relation who attend guest needs...Room is nice and very good location for both business and leisure. Should you stay during weekend, just join Jakarta activities on Sunday morning right in front of your hotel :)Just request back view instead of street view should you are so sensitive with the noise during your sleep at night...Use vallet service at this hotel as parking side is bit far from the lobby area
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and couldn't find any flaws: it's a good hotel. Even though the hotel is being renovated, quality is maintained.The only thing lacking is Indonesian atmosphere, the hotel could be located anywhere and be the same. It you are looking for a place that reminds you that you are in Indonesia, you have to go somewhere else. If it's comfort you are looking for, go here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of the great hotels i stayed in Jakarta. Good hospitality service and the best is that even the service staff knows you by name. Awesome and great. Will come here again one of these days. Only a few things that make me rate it as 4 stars is that this place is going through some renovation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Booked this hotel because of the location for only 3 nights in Jakarta. I was warned before that the rooms were dated. The lobby looks fine, huge & clean. The staff are really great, but it was already 2:00pm & we're told that our room in the cleaning process & it will take one hour. So we had to wait. While waiting I saw at least 3-4 family checking in after us and were told the same. One couple was so mad & told the front desk that seems common every time the come to this hotel. In fact the gentleman told the front desk that last time he ended up waiting 2 hrs for his room to get ready & he asked why this seems the case here. She just responded with a big smile and that's it.The room was so tiny reminded me with the rooms in NYC, but clean. Again no wash clothes in this hotel only bath & hand towels, but we noticed that their towels get stinky very fast, may be because they don't have a ventilation fan in the bathroom. The room rate includes the wifi, which is very convenience, but we noticed that the internet is sooooo slow!The swimming pool, the gym & the spa were really nice. I think we'll be back, just because of the location, compared to the neighbors hotels, this one offers a reasonable price. Their service was great to, when we asked fr something we get it fast & the front desk calls us back just to check that we get we asked for.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed for 2 nights for business. Conveniently located to big malls. Room was clean and comfortable. Good simple breakfast selection. Excellent gym with a good size pool if you're into a good workout. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman hotel have a excellent service,Clean. Breakfast its good. Good Location, have a good swimming poll. I recommend this hotel for business and leisure. Need more upgrade for Lift area. Best choice for me 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

great location... right in town... the room is clean and nice... yet it is very small for 2 adults and a little boy... no space for a boy to playthe hotel facilities is great. swimming pool is clean.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Positives were great location, quiet rooms despite being on a busy main road, very friendly staff, lovely gym and pool, and nice breakfast with lots and lots of variety.Negatives were that rooms are pretty small (particularly given the enormous lobby), the bathroom seemed a bit dirty with smeary marks all over the glass and mould in places, and one of the lifts was out of order so it took a long time to get anywhere in the hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My appreciation to Receptionist Staff who kind enough to hand me the bedroom key about one and half an hour upon my early arrival (8 am) in Jakarta after a long haul flights across the Pacific. This showed one good quality of true Jakarta hospitality. The bedroom itself was nice with comfortable bed even though the space was a bit smaller than what I have expected but the stylish furniture and interior arrangement were acceptable. Bathroom was also felt a bit smallish with small bathtub size. Elevators service was sluggish but it looked like they were still under upgrading process. Breakfast menu was excellent providing many healthy choices but it required us to willingly do a bit walk here and there to get to many food islands that scattered in the breakfast hall labyrinth. It was fun and enjoyable when there's not so crowded but by the peak time, it's difficult to walk around to get the favorable food. Overall, this hotel provides as many enjoyable adventure as the Jakarta city offers. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed in deluxed room, it is quite a big room and fully renovated, the deluxed room has two separate room, one for sofa and one for bedroom. Not many deluxe room hotel has that. I would recommend that, only one small note from me, when ai open the bathroom, the handle fell off. Apart from that the location is good, the room is great, the service is nice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The local is located on one of the major roads in central Jakarta, and across the street from two major shopping malls; Plaza Indoensia and Grand Indoenisa Shopping Town. Additionally, only one KM north of the hotel is the National Museum (which offers tours in English Tuesday-Wednesday at 1030am) and the Monas Monument.  The hotel itself is cute, if not a little old, but has a good selection of restaurants and in-room dining options. The pool is excellent and has these great cabanas you can lounge in.  The only real downside of the room is how small it is. They said I would have a king bed, but it's actually more of a queen/double.  I would recommend it because of its location and it's not that expensive for this area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

we been staying in this hotel for 6 days, we took an executive room, which is in new tower. real great place to stay as it located in the real heart of Jakarta, just need to walk down if you wanna go to grand indonesia or plaza indonesia. easy to shop and get food. this hotel have a great service too, all people are so nice, speak english fluently and wonderful ambiance. very clean and very large room. when we asked for 2 extra pillows, they provided us 6 extra pillows.. a real well done hotel. we love it. just you wont regret to stay here during your trip in Jakarta :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent hotel with variety of facilities it offers. value for money. Good shopping malls nearby for family shopping. Breakfast also offer foods for varied taste. Would like to stay again with family also. Spa was par excellence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a difficult title of review... I stayed in two connecting superior rooms with my family for three night in August 2012. Location is good for shopping and eating places, just accross the street you will find big shopping malls. Overall was not bad but Rooms was so small (big enough for Japanese standard) and not so clean, not sure if I got the old Nikko Hotel properties. Bedsheet and duvet cover were not perfect with some holes here and there. The bed was small compared to other 5 stars hotel in Jakarta, only 160x200 cm. Swimming Pool and Gym were perfect. The bakery was nice dan reasonable price.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We were here for 3 nights and had to change our room twice, due to poor room air conditioning. Not only us, our friends too had to change their room, they had requested for non smoking and got a strong smelled smoking room instead. Staff had extremely poor english, so sometimes we would have to call twice or thrice for people to understand what we required. Overall extremely dissappointing stay, would rather recommend the hyatt or mandarin in the same area. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The room in Pullman tower were just renovated , so it is quite nice. The view from room window was amazing, we can see bundaran HI and plaza indonesia. Service also very nice and professional. The swimming pool is quite large , elegant, and have just nice temperature. Breakfast has wide range of selection and quite high quality, except the bread. And one of the most important thing on my business trip, free wifi on the room!Location is definitely a BIG plus for this hotel. You can cross over to plaza indonesia and also to grand indonesia, biggest mall in the world ( it's even bigger and has more shop than mall in indonesia). You'll have no problem at all to find food from local taste to all around the world kind of food, they have it all available there.Now few things that made me put 4 star instead of 5:1) wifi is free but very frustrating connection. I tried few networks available, but none can connect me more than 5 minutes.2) elevator has a problem with the sensor , it's closing very fast and it hit me like 2-3 times on my only one day stay. All in all, it's a great hotel and i might come back in the future. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location in the center of the city near Bunderan HI. Stayed at Executive Tower, the room was clean and nice. Bathroom with shower and bath tub.In front of the hotel is Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia Shopping Mall. It's very nice shopping mall that every thing available there. Food court also available in Plaza Indonesia and grand Indonesia, with affordable price.Breakfast was good with so many choice from International, Indonesian, and Chinese breakfast.At second floor there's computer with free internet access, money changer also available. ATM also available behind the hotel.Very convenient stayed here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice hotel with nice location and huge swimming pool. Room facilities are in good condition although the room is rather small. What makes me a little upset was about the reservation that I made was not fully accepted even I had received confirmation from Accor. But that thing doesn't impact for the overall great service in this hotel. Sure to come back again on the next visit to Jakarta!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:Right in the heart of Jakarta, just a step to famous "Bundaran HI" where most famous hotels and shopping malls are in place. This hotel is perfect for shopping lovers since it is close to the famous Plaza Indonesia shopping mall and the biggest Grand Indonesia Shopping Town super mall.Receptionist:Very helpful and friendly.Room:Considering its 4,5 stars rated hotel, the superior room of this hotel is not so wide compare to that of other hotel with the same rate star.Breakfast:Various choices of menu are available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed at this hotel for 5 days for a business trip and all I can say is I had the most wonderful time. The staff were accommodating, helpful, friendly, prompt with our requests, and most of all, honest. Why do I say honest? Well, long story short, because a client booked the room for us, we didn't know that we had a special corporate rate. Upon check-out, it was the hotel that even informed and corrected us about our discounted bill. It's not a big deal if you really think about it, but I feel that it's always the little things that matter (like the hotel being the first to inform us, rather than waiting to see if we would know about the discount so they can get away with charging us more). As further testament to their excellent service, the hotel staff were always quick to lend a hand when you need directions, assistance with your bags or hailing you a taxi during the morning rush. As for the room, it was spacious, neat and the bed was absolutely divine thanks in large part to the pillows that are just to-die-for soft and comfortable! The room also came equipped with a small sofa, round table, a desk, flat screen TV and free LAN. I believe WIFI is available too but you need to ask for the code from the concierge. With regards to the bathroom, the hygiene kit was freshly stocked everyday and the toilet, shower and bathtub were spotless and regularly cleaned. In terms of locations, this hotel is as good as it gets. It is literally in the center of everything -- where all the action is. Behind the hotel is a quiet suburb and in front of the hotel is the high-end Plaza Indonesia Mall. A bunch of other malls and 5-star hotels line up the street as well so you know you're in a good area. For food, I was able to experience the breakfast buffet and their room service. I definitely have no complaints in that department! For breakfast, they have a very WIDE selection. Everyday I would try a different section of the buffet and I always found myself satisfied and happy. The dinner I got from room service was excellent as well. Normally they charge an exorbitant amount for room service but surprisingly, the rates they charged were affordable and reasonable (which is a first for me!)All in all, I definitely would not mind staying at the Pullman hotel again and I would strongly recommend this hotel to my fellow travelers! :) P.S --> Try the food court at Plaza Indonesia. Food is good, affordable and the place has GREAT ambiance!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed here many times and I love the location of the hotel. Opposite of Grand Indonesia means that my access to variety of food is awesome! Service is good and room is big. Breakfast is okay. The only thing I wish is the hotel has a pub with full piece band. At the moment, the hotel is super quiet at the lounge. All in all, good hotel! Will come back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in July'2012 for a week time and had wonderful experience...Its value for money...moreover its at prime location in Jakarta city...hotel staff is very courteous, I felt like home away from home...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Hotel (formerly Hotel Nikko) is a hotel catered for the business crowd. It was the cheapest 5 star hotel we found in the area.Whilst the rooms are very compact - they are functional especially for a solo traveller on business. I dont think its as suitable for honeymooners / couple type hotel especially if you intend on spending lots of time in the room. The hotel's facilities are great such as the pool and gym - and there is also a nice spa and the location is very convenient right opposite one of the major shopping centre - Plaza Indonesia, which ALL taxi knows where it is, unlike a lot of the other places - I found it quite common for taxi drivers to be lost eventho they nodded when I enter the taxi and first told them the destination.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had stayed in this hotel before the management change to Pullman group. I must the hotel has just improved quite a lot. Firstly, they gave a complimentary upgrade to a executive suite that was very cool. The room had fully automated controls and the 2 LED TVs with music in the bathrooms. The bathroom itself was the size of a bedroom. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was awesome, the service seemed a little slow, but everything else was very good. I would not hesitate to go back to the same hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A pretty enjoyable stay at Pullman Jakarta Indonesia. The hotel is very close to shopping centres. Rooms and lobby area are clean and spacious. Facilities are well kept.However, the hotel looks tired as it has been there for quite sometime. One downside was that I was given a smoking room despite asking for a non smoking room. The receptionist told me that we set up the smoking room as a non smoking room. But I know that this is not possible and when we enter the room, the cigarette smell was just overpowering. Though that is the case, I still look forward to stay at the hotel again after refurbishment next year. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The old Nikko Hotel, so location is good, smack on the Bundaran HI.We stayed at the Pullman Tower, which had its rooms renovated during Nikko's tenure, so they are still relatively new. I understand the Exec tower is scheduled for renovations in Oct'12.Since we got upgraded to a Deluxe room (Gold benefit), can't say for sure if the Superior is good, given that the listed room size is 21-25sqm. The Deluxe is about 40sqm, so there's a sizeable difference there, considering we paid Superior prices.The beds are great, so we got good sleep.Only problem was the bathroom drainage issue. Our room's shower cubicle couldn't seem to drain the water out at all, so we were standing in close to ankle-height water while showering. Could be just that room in particular though. Since we were only there for 2 nights, we didn't bother to make a complaint.Staff at the door were all smiles, and that's a nice thing to have throughout the day.Overall, I'd stay there again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LocationJust right in front of LV store, just across the road. If you are here for shopping, high end or not this is the perfect place. Right in the middle of congested area.  Check in Check in was quite slow actually for us but the staff were friendly though. I realized a lot of Japanese stayed here, not a problem anyway.RoomSo much for a king bed, it was nothing close to a king. The room was clean so was the bathroom. Wifi was also at good speed most of the time. You need id and password (they are offered free). Didnt try the food because it served pork. Kettle provided.Check outNo complaints really.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Its a perfect stay, bothered by the only charged for USD. 14 for printing my air ticket.Some staff are just pure stupid, when asked to print Air Ticket, and they print whole 14 pages.Other staff also very kind/good, I left something in the room and they send it to me for free. Just enough to make up for the USD. 14 I paid.Other than this its ok, really nice establishment
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stay in executive room with twin bed1. check in time is ok, front desk officer worked very well and fast enough2. location is perfect, with Plaza Indonesia on the other side of the street makes the view of this hotel is fantastic ( I chose the room with the view of Thamrin street ) 3. the room design is too old and too average for 5 star hotel, but that is not so annoying because I got free internet broadband ( but poor wifi signal )4. bathroom is large with separate bath tub and shower, I like the bathing ammenities such as bath foam, shampoo and conditioner5. the bed is fit enough for 4 of us to sleep ( 2 adults 2 kids )6. I couldn't get a later check out, they only gave me late check out until 1 o'clock , their excuses are the hotel were overbooked, but I didn't see that7. when I ask for spoon and fork from room service, it took more than 1 hour to get in to my room !! after I asked them again for the 2nd time.... whew.. that's something
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was told that this is a high end hotel but my experience didn't feel like one. Firstly the check-in was slow and impersonal; that didn't bode well already. We booked 2 executive club floor rooms and one standard room for our colleague but I have no idea why we weren't allowed any breakfast facilities for the executive rooms whereas my colleague (with the standard room) got breakfast. Just didn't make sense. Also it is a nightmare getting the bill in the Japanese restaurant situated within the hotel. My business associates and myself actually walked out of the restaurant without paying having asked for the bill twice with the bill never coming. The associates were tired and wanted to leave. So we actually walked out without paying, saw our guests off, before returning to the restaurant once again to request for the bill and pay. And again that took such a long time. Unbelievable.The final straw came when we were enjoying our club floor priviledges of evening cocktails and I was about to get my glass of wine when I was stopped. Apparently, guests were limited to a maximum of 3 glasses of wine. We are not supposed to go for a fourth. I am not an alcoholic, the glasses were reasonably sized but firstly, never in my travel experiences with club floors do I get informed that there is a limit to drinks. Also, there were 4 of us -2 members of my party didn't drink. So I mean, even if this hotel had this strange policy, couldn't they avail the wine allotment since then techinically we would have had 6 glasses of wine pending with the 2 members who were not drinking? I mean it is awkward being told such instructions. Very weird.To be fair the service was good at the Club Floor and very accomodating so I believe the directions came from the hotel management which just didn't make sense.Pullman Jakarta has a long way to go in terms of competing with the Mandarin and Hyatts. Will seriously have a think before staying there again. (It didn't help that the Club Floor room they gave us just refused to have connectivity. Standing in the corridor outside the room helped but really, do you want to be checking emails outside your hotel room?!) I think not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Very good location in the middle of the town, easy to shopping malls, restaurant and reasonable price. The room is a bit small for 2 but very clean. Staffs very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is not that excellent but just fine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

it was sucks.... room is very2 small...like busness hotel japan.. and really expensive...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Good hotels with good service, nice pool and fitness centre. But this hotel don't have RCTI channel on TV so we can't watch Indonesian Idol Final, why in such a big hotel like this don't have Indonesian channel like RCTI.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have got the room facing the city. What a view!! It's beautiful. The room is big but some of the furniture are dented. The room had a smoky smell, but after a while the smell is gone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

nice hotel, good bed, bath and shower in cold and hot, clear tv chanel, high speed internet. nice staff and helpfull. thanks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in this hotel during my recent trip to Jakarta. The reason why I chose to stay in this hotel was actually its strategic location and also the price. In comparison with other hotels nearby that area, I think it's pretty cheap and fair because it's located pretty near to the shopping malls. Security in this hotel is strict, in fact most places in Jakarta have tight security. Thus, if you wish to take pictures of the hotel lobby surroundings, don't be surprised if you're stopped. I was stopped for doing that and was told I could only take picture of the hotel lobby with someone posing for the shoot; in other words, taking picture of the hotel only without an human object is not allowed. The hotel room was small but still have enough walk room. We had the two single beds room and the single bed was really meant for single; really small. In terms of amenities, this hotel provided more than enough (shampoo, body shampoo, toothbrush set, sewing kit, cotton, soap, shower cap and etc.) and other facilities include hair dryer, television, coffee bar, complimentary wifi access to only 2 gadgets. In addition, there is a Japanese bakery located near the lobby and it serves really good pastries and buns. Thus, if you do not wish to have the hotel breakfast buffet, you may get some breads there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

as a member of accor Le club card , i would like to try this new accor hotel in Jakarta.the hotel is rebranded from Nikko hotel, the japanese chain Hotel. the best for this hotel is the location is in the main center of Jakarta city. close with all embassy and the best mall in town Grand Indonesia mall. easy to find food and entertainment. the room is not Pullman standard yet but according to their staff they will make renovation soon and rebranded all with Pullman standard. will see it happen soon, beacuse the room is too small compare with other Pullman Hotelthe japanese chef is very helpfull and nice to talk with him, he make the best dinner for us that night.overal i am satisfied stay in this hotel, but cannot wait to give a try for thier new room with pullman standard.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i was on my bussiness trip to jakarta, and Pullman Jakarta ( ex Nikko Hotel ) put my attention , as a member of Le Club Accor card, i would prefered to to give a try this new accor hotel.the location is superb , this hotel right in the main center of Jakarta city not far from Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia Mall...The room still ex Nikko room, althought the already put Pullman touch inside. but still not enough especially with the room space.the food is faboulous especially the japanese food, talk with the chef and he's very helpful to help and their special menu is fantastichopefully to see the real pullman soon after their renovation to be pullman
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i have bad experience when me and my families swam in hotel swimming pool. after check into 2 rooms (1 superior and 1 deluxe room), we went down to swim around 5.15 pm and the situation is very quite and not many people swam at that time. then , my kids and nephew were swimming. the total of them are 10 where 2 of them are 4 years old so their nanny swam to accompany them. after swimming, the lady in charge in swimming pool area insist us to pay for the excess of 2 people in the amount of rp. 198.000.-. their reason was because i booked 2 rooms where person entitle to swim only 8 person. while we have 10 people swim. i tried to explain that the excess because of 2 kids of 4 years old swam and so there must be someone to guard them. but they dont care at all. the other silly reason why we have to pay because we sit in the chair surrounding swimming pool so other people dont have the place to sit eventhough they knew at that time is very quite because near maghrib time. if we know that sitting there was also charged, ofcourse we will stay in our room waiting for the kids. but we were not informed about the sitting expenses. for info, we start swim at 5.15 and by maghrib time 5.55, we finished and back to our room, we only swim around 45 minutes and we still should pay eventhough we have already have 2 rooms in this hotel.. this hotel is not really welcome for family, too commercial so if i want to stay with family i will not go to this hotel again... i really dont like this experience staying in this hotel. they dont know how to treat people....especially for family.... i really dissapointed. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in Novotel Brighton Bay from 15 April for 2 weeks and passed my business card to the front desk officer for application of Accor membership card. However, the confirmation email never arrived.Subsequently I stayed at Pullman Jakarta Thamrin for 2 weeks from 21 May 2012 and requested for the Accor membership card to be issued. To date, no email has been received. I have emailed the Accor loyalty card site for help on 1st June 2012 and received no reply to date. I even called the help center and was told to apply for the card online by myself instead of replying on the front desk staff. However, all my points will not be credited to my card.This is utterly unacceptable that due to the staff mistakes, I have to forgo all my points. I checked with the front desk officers again and officers at both hotels insist its not their fault as they have submitted the form and the Accor help desk explained the form has not been received. Both parties insist there is nothing they can do to help and conveniently washed their hands off my case.No help is provided and reply given is vague with both parties blaming each other to me, the customer. This is bad. I have made reservation for my stay in Pullman Thamrin in July and September 2012 again but is considering cancelling my room booking given this horrible experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

very convenient business hotel, with a fantastic gym and pool. The rooms and bathrooms were comfortable and spacious enough. They provide a great shampoo.A few things that kept them from getting full ratings:The bridge connecting the Pullman to the shopping mall across the street was dissgusting and even scary. I was afraid I was going to get mugged, two guys approached me for "massage services," and the bridge smelled of urine. This is the one of the centers of Jakarta business and your link to a very nice shopping mall - why can't this be cleaned up?For a business hotel, the wifi offering was weak - connection speeds were slow, making skype challenging.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Pullman Jakarta is a nice place to stay because it is quite and comfortable inside the building and moreover in the bed room. The location is also strategic to go anywhere. It is very easy to go to the shopping mall and finding food. Breakfast is excellent and the people who serve there always serve with smile. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is kind of ageing, but overall it's acceptable. I was not too happy that it was very difficult getting from the annex building to the gym ( I was in my robe but there was no way I could walk through the loby in that). What made this hotel outstanding for me was how responsible they were when returning my things I left in the room. They sent me an email and made sure my friends in Jakarta got hold of them. Thanks to Pullman JKT. The shopping centre near by (plaza Indo) Had good food..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first stay at this hotel. Hotel has just rebranded and used to known as Nikko. Neverthelesss, still popular with Japanese executives. Transition not complete as some renovation not completed till year end. Had the a deluxe double room on 7th floor with king size bed. Room is clean and well maintained but small compared to other 4 and stars in Jakarta. One noticeable problem is that room is next to a busy main road. Traffic build up starts early and it is very noisy from 6 am. So don't expect to get a good rest! Requested for a change in room but was informed no non smoking rooms available. Breakfast was poor. Requested for poached eggs and got the strangest looking poach eggs I have ever seen or eaten. I will try to upload photos. Another minus is hotel has no air miles points with international airlines except Garuda. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Refurbished ex-Nikko Hotel in "the district to be" in downtown Jakarta, with easy access to main shopping malls and other main hotels (Kempinski, Hyatt, etc) that are the bread and butter of upscale and expat life in Jakarta. Very nice common zones and great service.I particularly did not like the room, which, while big and clean, and with decent bedding, had a tasteless look to it, be it for the choices in the decoration or the low energy consumption bulbs illuminating it. It looked unappealing.Nice shower with lots of pressure to spare and very nice towels too. Middle of the road amenities.All in all, probably the best "international" bang for the buck hotel in that part of town.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My trip to Jakarta began at this hotel. The property used to be the hotel Nikko and i always wondered why it changed? The feeling you get upon checkin is corporate to the max. The proprty is beautiful and is being refurbished as i write this. However there is a disconnect somewhere??? It seems that most of the staff are accustomed to dealing with business travellers and it shows. There is not much warmth or willingness to help unless asked at least twice. The rooms can be quite small and you get two choices of view. The traffic, mall, and Louis Vuitton or the parking lot. We changed rooms after our first night. Do not bother with the breakfast buffet! It is not included and is very expensive for what is offered. Again i think the issue is that it is mostly full of disgruntled business travellers and the staff try their best, but the buffet style set up is so disconnected, that it is hard and confusing to navigate. Overall the hotel is comfortable, but other guests are noisy and it is hard to ever feel relaxed. The highlight of our stay was a super nice and friendly girl who worked in the piano bar. The rest of the staff could get some tips frim her customer service.i wish we remembered her name but her smile will tell you who she is. There are numerous hotel options in Jakarta and my advice is to really research before you goPullman is no longer on my list
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Another Failure of Accors Group, that's the first comment.When you think calling their call center that you expect to get such a proffesional help in a better way,... think twice!!!. You feel exhausted right away after talking with these folks that always cut you when you talk, and talk around and around the bushes for no resolution. And you can't even find any Supervisor nor Manager on duty to help you case, after several calls that cut off and brings you to an unfriendly recording again and again.. and talking with different folks again and again. Very frustrating. Just remember one very important thing, if you stay in one of Accors Hotel, make sure you call this call center and check if your room is there and ask the confirmation number and get the details and proof. I always do that because couple times they screwed me and I learn from those experiences.Allright, here is the review, we start from here...The entrance of the hotel is guarded due to security issues I beleive, so we have to pass the body scan which I understand. None to greet me nor the our parties, normally I put it this way, this is first impression and one of the important step. From here, this is the very beginning that I want to judge about the service, so I start to feel, okay... I hope this is a nice hotel and people here. And let's give myself a chance and see..I found no smile from most of the employee and they are just like so stiff and tough, oh boi.. I am thinking that I am going to experience Jakarta's prison or dungeon. But again I said to myself and the group, OK Gang..let's see whether the advertising we seen is true.Tra..ra.ra.., feel so happy and excited, because we have important reservation dinner with friends and family in Shangri-La Hotel and most of the group are first time come to Jakarta nor Indonesia. We want to put our bags in the room, get cleaned and go, since we will only stay one nite in this big city. A customer who stands next to me at the reception already grunting about his stay and I feel like oh boi..I hope I will be okay...., Guess what happen?, the nightmare begins...Reception informed me that my reservation cancelled and only one room that is provided instead of 3room that paid. Again, Accors must retrain all employee for Customer Service Skills. Talking here and there and has no solutions and requested to pay for the other 2rooms and eventhough we have proof and after showing our bank account and statement that it's been charged and such, No luck.... All parties are so upset and tired and don't understand why, how, and what? And this already take 1hour and 30minutes, and that's it ..our Important Dinner was gone gone.And reception still insisting to pay and doesn't care if it's paid or not and only showing us, this is what it is. I understand that some people are trouble and opportunistic. We came from half of the world flying from America and stay for one nite in Jakarta and do you think we want to cancel these rooms??? I or God must be crazy, like the movie!!!.The hotel can't even tell us, who cancel the room and why was that happen. Meanwhile, is to ask us to contact Air Asia whereas we bought our package to deal with. I can say right away, that this is not a customer service oriented. (By the way, this is another thing, Air Asia is one of the worst customer service in travel/airline business too, I emailed them as well and even until today, I have not heard anything from them...NOTHING). Finally we had a chance to talk to the Duty Manager (Mr.Muhammad Hafidz), and after he checks for a while and has no idea what is going on and what happen. So he allow us to have the 3 rooms, 2 are being upgraded (which I don't see this type of room Deluxe Jr Suite in Accors web nor in other agency web). He is asking a credit card to guarantee in case there is something wrongdoing happened and meanwhile, The Duty Manager will make more research. So, speaking of this nightmare, it's almost 2 hours dealing with this kind of dramaAnd we feel so horrified, terrified, you named them.One thing I hear a beautiful word came from this duty manager at the end..., "Is there anything that I can do to make you feel comfortable", trust me, that is a basic of customer service and everyone who works in this service should be able to say this, not only the Manager!!!. Why I can say this, because I am or we are working in the same busness just different field . Of course we don't want to give the whole store to satisfy customers but a compassion and sympathy have been missing during the whole scenarios.Make story shorts, we just put our bags in the room and just go accross the street to have some bite at Grand Hyatt Hotel, we don't even want to deal with anything no more nor eat in this hotel because we figure it will have more problem. Allright, I am about to stop for my novel and now get back to the review.Seems, everyone must slide your room card in the elevator in order to go to your room.It's not really conveneince because you can not visit your friends room at your own time and must go to lobby first and meet each other and go back to whatever your friend's room.The deluxe junior suite is biger than junior suite room.The size of this room is so spacious with living room and dining seperately as well as the bathroom also the walking closet.Junior Suite Room is small and I don't like the bathroom at all, it's just to small and it makes you feel so claustrophobic.But on top of everything, the linen, the towel are fresh and nice and the room is clean, that's important one. TV and Refrigerator are available in the room as well.The only thing that I like the most is the Toiletries, from Roger and Gallet, I love them since prolly I use their products as well. Please remember, although the hotel has such elegant room but if the service is terrible, it won't count, it's just wasted, right there!., sorry to say this.The other thing that the Hotel Management needs to know, we call housekeeping to check on something. I am not sure if this person awares surround him or not, seems like he cares not, just walking in the room without a word excuse me or something and bang.. I am there in the bathroom and nude and he suddenly shows up and stands there and he stares at me and I just say to my self what in the world happening here and after he checks on something and he just goes away. What a show!. My question here is do they have or learn about etiquette? I guess I am wrong again.The bed is nice and comfy and I sleep well.Newspaper is sent to your room in the morning.I don't try the food nor breakfast since this hotel I beleive that they have option either you want to take the b'fast with you or not, it's your choice.You expect that you will get at least some brief explanation from reception when check in, prolly to say, we have WiFi here or if something we can do or whatever...nope, you won't hear it...!!So I would say, like my title, this is like a playground...I feel sorry for everyone in my group to spend such amount of $$$ and stay in such a terrible ambiance...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Though it is 5 star hotel but it 's wifi connectivity in the room is so bad until I cant even get online ! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been staying for 3 days at the Pullman. The stay was nice and so are the staff, in the end I was almost sorry to leave.Upon arriving all the hotel guests are required to go through the security check before we can enter the hotel premises. Heading straight to the reception for my check in, I was surprised that they allowed me to check in before offical check in time. The service is fast and good. The hotel provides WiFi service in the room and the password was given to me quickly.Entering the room, it was small at first sight. The bathroom is not spacious and there are some stains around the bath tub. They do not have standing shower. They only provide the bath tub.The bed was one thing that if I could take him home, I would have done. Hard in the right places and comfortable....Very rich and tasty breakfast, they do have the Japanese, Western and Indonesian sections. The hotel facilities is fantastic, I enjoyed the pool, the gym and indoor spa(Hot & Cold pool). Pullman Jakarta Indonesia is within walking distance of Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia shopping centers. These are the things that made me enjoy my stay at this hotel, but my warmest congratulations to the hotel for their choice of personnel. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From the time we arrived at Pullman Thiamin we were treated exceptionally. As we were staying 11 nights and knowing we would be spending a significant amount of time at the Hotel we had decided to book Junior Suites. Unfortunately only one Non-smoking room was available. When we suggested that we would not use a smoking room the staff had no hesitation in upgrading one of the rooms to an apartment. Both rooms were very well appointed including a washer/dryer, kitchen and living room in the apartment which was useful given the length of our stay. The rooms were perfectly clean on arrival and well maintained throughout our stay.We breakfasted and every day in the Executive Lounge and also took advantage of the evening buffet and drinks on a number of occasions. The staff were exceptionally friendly and the food and service excellent.Being centrally located was of great benefit as we were working at numerous sites around Jakarta. The view from the Pullman afforded us a great view of the Monument and Fountain, including a birds eye view of the Mayday Celebration/Demonstration! Access to excellent shopping malls, a really good Wine Bar and a German Beer Restaurant was only minutes away.The only down side we would comment on would be the Wine List and the cost of wine. Essentially AUD$10 wines for the equivalent of AUD$70+.All in all highly recommended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stayed overnight with a beautifull and huge hotel like pullman promises huge rooms too but i was wrong,after i checked in a few days ago,im so dispointed with small room that they gave to me.i stayed in this hotel for 5 days and paid a lot of money for my vacation,but i rather to stay in small hotel which can provide me with the big room to stay.receptionist girls was nice but they need to prove their english skill.....they absolutely did not understand our request for breakfast,unfurnately we got no breakfast for our stay in this hotel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had stayed in the Executive Tower room and the room size is reasonably big. The bathroom is spacious which has a seperate bath tub and standing shower area. Room is clean and pillows are just the right firmness for me. I liked the Oaks lounge which has a cigar corner and opens till late night. Good place for a cigar chill out in the night. Staffs are very friendly and helpful too.Only thing that i feel can be improved better is their wireless broadband in the room. The signal is very very weak and keep losing the connection to get onto the internet. Only solution is to connect via the LAN cable. :( Other than this, this hotel location is very excellent. Just walked across the hotel is a big shopping mall with all the major brands shops and lots of eateries and restaurant. For business travellers this is a hotel worth considering in Jakarta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, but the rooms can be very smallI stayed here for two nights in Oct 2011. The hotel is okay overall. A good location – right opposite the Plaza Indonesia shopping centre, and very close to Grand Indonesia as well. The hotel personnel are fine, breakfast was okay and the other facilities were generally quite nice. The main issue is that you have to choose your room carefully. I ended up in a very small room – about 21m2. Just enough space to turn round, but not much more. Admittedly it was pretty cheap, but if you want a bit of comfort, then book a larger room – or if you can afford it, go to the Mandarin or Hyatt hotels, that are close by.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The rooms were very good, the beds excellent, the staff friendly, the reception area sterile and uninspiring and they repeatedly had a singer accompanied on violin and piano which drove me crazy, the breakfast overpriced, location pretty good for shopping, the bar was really disappointing, no atmosphere.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pullman Tower where I stayed has the refurbished rooms. It's modern and just the right size to stay in (Deluxe Room with 1 King-Size Bed: 40 sqm). I liked the location, centralised and easy to walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good and clean hotel, however rather disappointing for a 5 Star Pullman standard. Room size vs price is bad, expected more from Pullman. Room phone didn't work, then hairdryer, then toilet ventilation. When asked for a room change, only changed to the same floor, where toilet ventilation still didn't work. As a frequent traveler and supporter of Accor group, i felt rather disappointed that the 5 star Pullman has this bad standards.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I stayed in a Deluxe room which included breakfast and internet (they told me this as I checked in!) and I was very pleasantly surprised with the room considering other reviewers had made comments about the size of the room. I had a separate good sized living area with couch, desk, coffee machine and tea facilities. The bathroom was spacious with a separate bath and shower. Shame about hearing the carpark calls via microphone, even up on the 10th floor, not such a great 6am wake-up call. Only a 2 minute walk to Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia shopping malls there was plenty to do in my free evenings. Service in the hotel was great, with very helpful staff. Despite what other reviewers said about breakfast I found the breakfast excellent, all your usual buffet breakfast options plus some asian (indoneisa and japenese) options too. I did eat in the hotel 3 times, once in origami and twice in the Olive tree, I was disappointed in the quality and taste although the servings were huge and not the usual hotel prices. I had some great meals over in Plaza Indonesia, try Nannini's and the Goods Company Cafe or Ninety-nine at the basement of Grand Indonesia - West (I think). Shame I wasn't able to get out and about too much and see the other sides of Jakarta but definitely a good base to start from!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Liked the location (financial centre, near two big shopping malls and many restaurants), and the hotel offered all a business traveller would be looking for. Very pleased. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, this is absolutely NOT a 5-star hotel as they claim. Maybe a 3 to 4 stars...depending on which tower you stay in (Pullman is 4, Executive is 3-).Basically it's 2 different hotels joined by a lobby/bar/restaurant area on two floors - the Pullman Tower and the (so-called) Executive Tower. When booking demand the Pullman Tower, otherwise you might end up in the Executive Tower, which desperately needs renovation (promised to start mid 2012 - but don't bet on it).Not a good experience right from the start (I arrived end March 2012). Check-in set a new record in slowness. The porter, after insisting on pulling my one small bag to my room, stood waiting with his hand out for a tip as soon as he put the bag in the middle of the floor (literally true). I hate that. Having come straight from the airport I didn't have a lot of small bills, so I gave him most of them. This is no exaggeration - he looked down at the notes as though I had put something nasty there and said "Too small," and stood waiting for more. It was probably about half a day's pay for him! So...bad start.My first 2 nights I was in the Executive Tower, 'Executive Deluxe Room'. At first glance, after traveling for 24 hours it looked small, but OK - it was night time, I was tired. Next day I see reality.Carpet is stained, generally dirty and absolutely needs replacing - disgraceful. The furniture is old, chipped and stained. Stuffy and smelling vaguely of animals, the room was dim and poorly ventilated, and the AC (even at a setting of 10C) barely stirred the air. The shower drain was almost blocked and took 2 hours to drain water away. Etc..etc..etc. Avoid this tower.I moved to the Pullman Tower (also a Deluxe Room). This tower is older, but was renovated in 2011 and looks better, but still it's no more than 3.5-4 stars. Room is bigger and as you might expect, as a more modern look and feel. Carpet is a dirty grey colour - is it meant to look dirty, or is it actually just dirty?One positive - the breakfast is quite good, as long as you get there before 10:00, otherwise they are closed.The hotel seems to cater mainly for Asian visitors, and my colleagues and I definitely didn't feel welcome. Generally the staff are distant, not friendly, and not at all welcoming.I've stayed at several hotels in the area. If you want a real 5-star, and professional (cool) efficiency go to the Grand Hyatt. If you want friendly, cheapish, and a bit down at heel try the Sari Pan Pacific. What the Pan Pacific lacks in modern, and good furniture it makes up for by being friendly and welcoming - just go and eat at the Hyatt if you want the best food in town (C's restaurant).So - my advice, in summary - stay somewhere else.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a hotel that is right in the center of Jakarta and in Tharmin area-close to the Presidential Palace and other large hotels such as the Kempinski and Hyatt. Previously branded as the Nikko the hotel is very comfortable for the business traveler. Free WiFi and breakfast definitely helps. Try and take a non smoking room and stay away from the bar if you are a non smoker as folks in Jakarta generally are heavy smokers and no amount of air conditioning can keep you away from second hand smoke. The hotel serves a decent breakfast but the coffee shop closes early at around 1030 pm and the only option for a late night meal is room service or the bar (Oak Room) which also closes at 1 am. All in all for the price the hotel is a decent find. There is some amount of renovation that is on going at the property but hopefully not so intrusive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have stayed in this hotel at least a dozen times in the past 3 years (it used to be managed under the 'Nikko' brand until the end of 2011 - now it is under the 'Pullman' brand of Accor Hotels). It is one of the cheapest international hotels to stay in central Jakarta, and if you know which room to choose, your stay can be quite nice. Rooms that have been already renovated in the main tower of the hotel offer nice amenities with simple design and toned-down (brownish-grayish) color palette that can be relaxing after a long workday in busy Jakarta. The new tower is undergoing renovation right now, so rooms might be still of the old design, and that tower might be noisy too because of the ongoing work.All in all, food (breakfast and room service) is good, and the pool is new and clean (although not as lush with vegetation and popular as the Grand Hyatt pool). The hotel should offer a good stay for a short business trip.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We stayed at pullman on january when it just changed their name from nikko. I booked the hotel as nikko bt when i get there its already pullman. Cause i stayed there a day after they changed their name the situation in the hotel is still hectic. In the room there r no information books, room service menu, notes and others cause they r not ready yet according to the staff. The staffs r nice and helpfull though. The room is ok but bed is small. Their king size is not regular 2 meter in length but only 1.8. Poor my hubby cause he is over 1.8 tall so he has to sleep sideways. The breakfast is very basic, not that good. The pool is nice and big just need more unshadow areas for tanning. The location is awesome, near couples big malls and the hotel provide shuttle for guest to go there so that was awesome..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wide lobby. Staff attentive but not really knowledgeable. Service slow in bars and around pool.Room service only fair. Room small. Bed comfortable. Wide range of TV stations - some dubbed. Good security.Second floor under major construction scheduled to be completed in April 2012. Business center not open 24hrs a day. Internet in rooms OK although signal dropped for no apparent reason.Nice pool area although only about 18 sun beds. excellent well equipped gym
-------------------------------------------------------------------

i stayed in this hotel in mid March 2012...., wide lobby...Really very good location : Plaza Indonesia and Grand Indonesia malls and busway station are in front of this hotelNice rooms though not so spacious (see pictures attached)Breakfast: you can enjoy your breakfast while seeing Thamrin street and bunderan HI. Very comfortable...Muffin, bread, croissants were good enough, average taste.The way they serve Papaya need to be improved...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Just returned from a weekend in Jakarta to visit friends and family. Booked 2 nights at the Pullman down in Thamrin. Great location, right across from the major shopping malls. I've stayed at the Pullman in Bangkok (which is AWESOME) so was expecting something similar as my perception of the brand was set by that experience. Yeahhhh that didn't really happen so much!Pulled up late Friday night; lobby and atrium was very "Pullman" like; very nice. Check-in was quick and efficient. Was given a room on the fifth floor in the old tower/main tower (whatever they call it) facing the street. I was located right across from the elevator; you literally walked out and went maybe 4 or 5 steps and that was my room. Ugh! I normally do not stay in a room in this situation and almost always return to the front desk asking for a room away from the elevator bank; for some stupid reason I didn't - perhaps I was just exhausted as it was nearly 1 AM at this point. I thought it would be ok...it wasn't and I paid dearly for it. The room was very very dated looking; the interior looked like it hadn't been updated entirely - probably leftover remnants from the Hotel Nikko days. The bathroom was renovated I believe but it was small and the tub basin area looked like it needed a good scrubbing, The room was relatively clean, but for a Pullman I was extremely disappointed as to how it was appointed. I went to bed, only to be woken up at around 6 or something by people checking out early, and then again and again by people leaving/house phone ringing, etc. etc. There was also a constant "thumping" sound coming from the streets in the evening; I guess there was a loud club with a strong bass nearby! Bed was also quite uncomfy. Woke up and decided "yeah, I need to switch rooms." Staff was very kind and helpful and gladly acceded to this request moving me to the 9th floor with a view of Menteng (opposite side). I asked for a room in the new tower but apparently my room type only existed in the older tower. Anyway, new room: what a difference! Gone was the noise. I was also put in a room that appeared to be more updated; it had some features and some lighting that my previous room didn't. Bathroom was also a bit cleaner although I noticed the coasters that they put the glasses on in the bathroom were disgusting; totally gross and like they hadn't been changed in ages. Bed was still an issue; slept a bit better but was still sore the next morning.  I really want to give this hotel a better rating; partly because the staff is quite nice and the location is good, but for the price you pay; coupled with the fact that its also a Pullman - it just didn't really live up to my expectations. Perhaps they are going through updating the look of the hotel still from the old Hotel Nikko days. I think if I hadn't stayed on the 5th floor the first night, this would be getting better marks in my book...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

2 very negative points:1) terrible smell in the room. Maybe originated from the aircon. Open window just helped temporarly.2) problems with the acceptance of rewards for payments during check out. Print format not accepted.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located across from a very upscale mall, and has very tight security. the hotel has an excellent well equipped gym, and a spa that has wonderful massage service at a fraction of what you would pay at similar hotels anywhere else.The breakfast spread is big, but very light on local Indonesian items. mostly western and Japanese stuff, which is a shame as i would have liked to try more indonesian food. same for the a la carte menu. for a 6 page menu, onlly half a page for Indonesian food is not great for a hotel in Jakarta. the rooms are very comfortable - i was on the 4th floor facing Thamrin and barely heard the road noise, and well appointed. the only thing missing was an iron/ironing board. that is now considered standard equipment in most good hotels. the only negative was the very slow housekeeping - i came back to the room at between 2-4 pm every day and the room was not cleaned yet. so i had to go out again and wait.For shopping I would skip the mall and walk 10 minutes to 'Sarinah' where there is a lot of good souvenier and batik shopping on the top floor, or the airport.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I had made on-line reservations and made full payment. Hotel check-in time is 2pm. I arrived at 2.30pm and was told that I had to wait for an hour as the room was not ready. After having lost patience, waiting for about 20 minutes, I demanded that my room be allocated immediately. It took them some time before deciding to give me an upgrade and make the room available.Wired wi-fi in the room is very bad. The hotel IT technician had to install a router in my room to improve the quality. This, I understand, is a perennial problem at the hotel.Breakfast spread was not appealing and very limited. Not worth spending money on breakfast at the hotel.I doubt if I'll be staying at this hotel again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, this hotel is wonderful. Few suggestions that I may have is that the some of front desk people are slower than expected, not all the items on the menu containing pork and alcohol are identified for Muslim customers (even though many are identified with a pig picture), and the deluxe wing should have a different check in counter as it used to have earlier to avoid delays for check in .
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotel Nikko recently renovated and change its uniform into Pullman makes me wonder how good and cozy is this hotel. The location with no doubt is very strategic face on two biggest and luxury mall in Jakarta plus iconic "welcome statue fontain' will make this hotel exceptional. I pick a room face on the Thamrin road where I can see traffic and Plasa Indonesia Extention, when night came, glittering light sparks by the streets and shopping mall is really makes you dazzle. The room itself is clean equipped by LCD TV, cozy bed mattress, working desk and study lamp where I can doing my work. Unfortunately the size of the room is too small, with all in one in one room. Makes you hard to move with desk and sofa surround you. Recommended for those who has business travel in Jakarta with their mobility level.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

hotel verry clean. good location,breakfast, good all fasility. near from moll and nice spa. i will come again.. in down town jakarta. and nice poll......................................................................
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Checked in on 24th February for 3 nites stay.Hotel: Building is in very good condition & it is HUGE!!! Exterior is bright + clean. Interior is decorated very nicely but sparsely with modern furniture & again it is HUGE!! The hotel lobby is so spacious that you can do somersaults without knocking into anything!! Serious!! Anyways, I had a good 1st impression of this hotel.Location: Hotel is located in the very center of Jakarta’s business and leisure district, about 45-60 mins cab ride from the Airport. No other means to get here. Juz cabs. It is also within walking distance of Plaza Indonesia, EX + Grand Indonesia shopping centers. Convenience: A lot of shops + restaurants within 1-5mins walk so u will never go hungry + u can shop, shop, shop till you drop!!! Dining: Had my daily breakfast @ the Olive Tree. The restaurant is very nicely decorated. The American-Japanese breakfast (starts as early as 5.30am!) spread is not huge but it did filled the tummy! So no complaints there. Did dined at the Origami Restaurant, serving Japanese buffet dinner. Thou the service staffs were excellent, the spread however is small & not that spectacular. So do not waste your 450,000++ Ind Rupiah per pax dining here.Room: The room, unlike the lobby, unfortunately is ridiculously SMALL! Dun like. Not much space to run around & throw my clothes all over.Bed: Luv the bed + lurvvvveee the pillows!! I slept really gud thru'out my stay. This is definitely a HUGE big thumbs up from me!! :)) Toilet: Like the room, their toilet is also ridiculously SMALL. And the toilet glass door cannot be closed properly. So if u were having a mini typhoon in ur tummy, the noises u made will definitely be heard by ur other half lying in bed AND chances are you will stink up the whole entire room bcoz of the small toilet + small room with unlock door!! But the toiletries, shower, tub is gud. No complaints there.Staffs: Friendly. Efficient. Check-in was fast & breezy. Room service was good. Everything I asked for @ anytime of the day were met! Even go all the way to ask around for a Blackberry charger when I absently misplaced mine.Hotel guests: Mostly Asians.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the name was Nikko, and now change to Pullman. The lobby was huge but the room was small.. the bathroom was also small, just fit for one people. Usually for cut time, one shower, one brush teeth, but it cannot be done for this time.. the bathroom was still the old one, shower at the bathtub, so the water is going crazily all over the bathroom.. :)But i love the sofa at the corner, i just feel comfort sitting there to see the traffic or see outside view at night and daydreaming.. Love it also because near the Plaza indonesia, EX and Grand Indonesia, just across the street..
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This hotel has been renamed Pullman Jakarta, currently under Accor Hotel group since Jan 2012.Location is fantastic, out of 3 in 1 (better traffic situation) and is near to malls (Grand Indonesia), Hyatt,.....Club lounge was on the 15th floor, but I seems to be the only person using the facilties. It's quite underutilized. Maybe many guests were not aware?Guest Service desk has a Japanese speaking staff which was great, but was some distance from the front desk. Front Desk however was frequently busy whenever I pass by. I noticed front desk staff were not fluent in English / other popular languages such as Japanese/Chinese and so on a few occasions, I saw guests trying to draw on pieces of paper to describe to the front desk staff. One weird issue I had was, I booked a room without breakfast. Upon arrival, I paid to upgrade to a club room with access to a club lounge that serves breakfast, high tea and cocktail. However, I was told that as I did not pay for breakfast in my first booking, I will charged for breakfast if I consume it in the club lounge - which puzzled me because I thought I paid for the upgrade to the club room with the club lounge access? I asked for confirmation on this arrangement twice and was confirmed correct. Club lounge access was limited to 1 pax. I asked for additional 1 guest access to lounge (same hotel guest but in a lower room) for 1 night and was allowed after several requests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I happened to stay in this property as the organizers setup a workshop on 16th Feb at this place. The Lobby is majestic and huge and I had never such a huge lobby in any property. But, to my big surprise, the rooms are tiny and as soon as you open the door, you are on the foot of the bed. Why such a contrast? Where all those architectural skills gone? The bath room is fitted with a TOTO wash basis but you hardly happy to you it. But, one thing I must admit, for the location, the charges are very nominal and value for money is guaranteed!!

It is so Japanese,particularly the room.so small.but I still love the hotel because of the hotel is so close by to Thamrin City.the Muslimah fashion shopping.I just walked about 10 min from the hotelthe tanah abang is also very close by.taxi about 5 min,but Jakarta traffic, it took me 30 min.The buffet was also Japanese style. But the dining area had a romantic deem light setting.I love it.I think they are similar price like Nikko if you are concerned the small size room
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotel is located right in the heart of the shopping and commercial zone. The huge Louis Vuitton across the way from the hotel is hard to miss and an indication of where you are.The lobby and the entrance is clean with lots of glass, airy and bright. The staff are friendly but the check-in for a business hotel was slow. There are signs of age if you look, starting with the staff name tags. Maybe its just me, but if details like this are allowed to slide, I begin to wonder what else I haven't noticed is allowed to slide, hygiene, perhaps safety? I mean having shiny new legible staff name tags is something that is relatively easy to do and if that is sliding, well...I had an executive room (larger of the 2 room types), which is about the size of a standard American or Australian room in a 4 start business hotel. The room was clean overall, very utilitarian and gave the impression of being sparse with small bars of soap, threadbare carpets and empty nightstands. Compared to a properties such as the W, Westin and Hilton, the amenities are very basic and as mentioned before give the impression of utility bordering on parsimony and further reinforce the impression that this property has seen better days.In-room wifi access is free. Expect speeds of about 1Mbps. The air-conditioning takes a while to get up to speed so take that into consideration when leaving for the evening and expecting the room to be comfortably cool when you get back.

There were roaches in the room. However I must say that after a complaint to the front desk, they were apologetic and I was immediately upgraded to a bigger room.Great business and shopping location though!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is the best one in Jakarta if you are on business. Good value for money. However, not in the same league as Grand Hyatt, (the newly renovated) Mandarin or Kempinski. The restaurant Kahyangan has an excellent Shabu-Shabu. Breakfast was excellent as well. Across the street you will find some good shopping locations and a great bar with life music called "Immigrant".

when I checked in that night it was still a Nikko hotel, the deluxe room was quite spacious even though I guess the furniture is quite dated. It was raining during the journey from the airport to the hotel so I arrived quite late and I thought I would just ordered dinner from the room service.... it took me 1 hour till my dinner finally arrived and that was after 3-4 calls made to the room service.Other than that it was quite ok, check in was fast, even faster on checkout at 7:30am in the morning and by the time I checked out it was already known as Pullman and they have change all the signs in the hotel to Pullman Hotel

I like the Nikko for the relative value for money you get when compared with the other 5-star hotels around the area. It is owned by Japan Airlines (JAL) and seems to be preferred by Japanese business travellers - at least during the working week. It is ideally situated across from the city's top shopping malls (Plaza Indonesia). Its Japanese background assures good standard accommodation and high-quality food - naturally Japanese cuisine is the main focus. The flip-side of it is that those who need spacious rooms, may suffer from claustrophobia - at least in the deluxe rooms while the superior rooms in the tower tract of the hotel premises offer more space. The interior deco is modern and well maintained and all the facilities that normally come with 5-Star accommodation are available.
